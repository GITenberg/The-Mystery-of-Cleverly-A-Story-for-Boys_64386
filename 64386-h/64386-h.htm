</div>


<p>“If you fellows don’t open that door and let me
in, there’ll be trouble in this town before long.”</p>

<p>The only answer was a mocking laugh from the
group of boys to whom this threat was addressed.</p>

<p>Herbert Harkins, his face red with rage, pounded
his fist on the panels of the schoolhouse without
making the slightest impression upon his fellow
schoolboys.</p>

<p>“Open the door,” he cried again, in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Once more a peal of laughter sounded from within.
The scene of this incident was the Cleverly
District School. The time was the second of January,
and the occasion was the annual frolic of the
boys, known as “barring out day.”</p>

<p>It was a custom which, originating down east, had
spread to the little town in New Jersey. The
method was quite simple. After the Christmas<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
holidays the big boys put their heads together and
decided on a plan of campaign. When all of the
details had been arranged, it was decided to put
them into execution at the first regular session of
the new year. The forenoon passed off as quietly
as any other day, the boys looking very sober and
extremely attentive to their studies, and keeping
unusual order. The moment the schoolmaster left
the house for his dinner and the smaller children
were started homeward, the doors and windows
were suddenly and securely locked, and the older
pupils proceeded to spend the afternoon in play and
hilarity.</p>

<p>When Mr. Anderson, the teacher, returned about
one o’clock, he was surprised to find the schoolhouse
in a state of siege. He made an attempt to enter,
but failed. It so happened that Herbert Harkins
was the only one of the larger boys who had been
locked out. Under ordinary circumstances he would
have taken the incident good-naturedly; but in this
case he knew that the teacher was frail and delicate,
and Herbert’s regard and sympathy for Mr. Anderson
aroused all his manly instincts and brought
his fighting blood to the boiling pitch. The teacher
who had been employed in this district only a few
weeks, was evidently of a sickly disposition. It
was a cold day. He was insufficiently clad, and
the prospect of taking some sickness which might<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
perhaps lead to pneumonia and death made the poor
man quite miserable. His face was beginning to
get blue with the intense cold; but he was too weak
to resort to any physical methods for opening the
door.</p>

<p>Herbert knocked again; but his appeal was received
only with jeers and shouts of derision. Mr.
Anderson turned to him with a kindly smile, and
said:</p>

<p>“There is no need of doing anything more, Herbert.
I thank you for your good intentions; but
I think the only thing left for me to do is to go
home for the day.”</p>

<p>As Herbert was about to reply he happened to
glance upward and noticed the smoke coming from
the chimney on the top of the schoolhouse. He remembered
that the room was heated by means of
an old-fashioned wood fire, which was constantly
replenished during the day. Whenever a fresh or
green log was placed on the fire, more or less smoke
went up the chimney. As Herbert gazed at the
little curls of smoke making their way skyward,
he suddenly conceived a means of breaking up the
siege in the schoolhouse and procuring entrance for
himself and the teacher. To think was to act. A
small pile of lumber lay in the roadway nearby.
Herbert walked over to it and picked out a wide,
square board. It was quite heavy; but by dint of<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
much energy and persistence he managed to get it
under his arm and carry it to the schoolhouse. Mr.
Anderson wondered what he was about to do. The
boys on the inside, too, gazed at this unexpected
activity with much interest. Herbert’s next move
was to secure a large ladder, which he put up against
the side of the house. Then reaching for the board,
he made his way to the top of the schoolhouse and
in less than two minutes had placed it over the top
of the chimney. Then he hurried down the ladder
again, and rejoining Mr. Anderson, said calmly:</p>

<p>“I am willing to wager that we will be inside
of that schoolroom before you have time to count
a hundred.”</p>

<p>And so it proved. The smoke, unable to find its
way out of the chimney, was thrown back into the
schoolroom, and in a minute’s time the boys were
choking from the effects of the fumes. Some were
in favor of holding out, but when their eyes began
to run water and they were filled with a stifling sensation,
they quickly decided to surrender. The bars
were taken down and the doors and windows thrown
open.</p>

<p>Herbert, delighted with the success of his little
scheme, remounted the ladder, and going to the
roof, took the board from the chimney. The boys
made no further attempts at disturbance; within
fifteen minutes order had been entirely restored,<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
and the afternoon session went on as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>Most of the boys were filled with admiration at
Herbert’s cleverness; but a few of them murmured
against him and threatened to punish him for breaking
up their fun. The largest of these boys was
Arthur Black, who was a year older than Herbert,
and had the reputation of being the bully of the
school. After the children had been dismissed for
the afternoon, they gathered in groups outside the
schoolhouse and talked about the unusual event.
Arthur Black raised his voice above the others, declaring
that he had a great notion to thrash the boy
who had dared to interfere with their sport. Some
of the more timid pupils approached Herbert and
advised him to hurry home in order to escape punishment.
He smiled at their fears, however, and
said he had no reason for running away. Just then
Arthur Black approached.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” he asked in an insulting
voice.</p>

<p>“I said that I had no reason for running away,”
replied Herbert quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s because you haven’t got any sense,”
was the ugly rejoinder. “You’re a sneak and a
busybody and ought to be thrown out of the school.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p>“Because you spoiled our fun,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s much fun to keep a sick teacher
out in the cold and make him run the risk of losing
his life. I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve had enough of your talk,” said Arthur,
interrupting Herbert.</p>

<p>“But you will listen to what I have to say,” persisted
Herbert manfully.</p>

<p>“No I won’t,” was the rejoinder, “and if you
say another word I’ll thrash you within an inch of
your life.”</p>

<p>“Two can play at that game,” said Herbert
coolly.</p>

<p>The other made no reply, but began to take off
his coat, and flinging it on the ground, started to
roll up his shirt sleeves. Instantly the other boys
formed a ring about them. There was nothing left
for Herbert but to accept the invitation that was
thrown down to him in such a noisy way. He took
off his coat, and in a trice the two boys were engaged
in a rough and tumble fight. It looked for
a time as if Arthur Black, who was the older and
heavier of the two, would get the better of Herbert.
The boys crowded around the two fighters and urged
them on with yells and shouts of approval. Herbert
kept comparatively cool, and at a critical stage in
the fight he pummeled Arthur so vigorously that
he cried for mercy. Indeed his nose was bleeding
and one of his eyes was beginning to show evidence<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
of the contest. Picking up his hat and coat, and
hardly able to repress his tears, he hurried off towards
his home. Herbert was immediately proclaimed
the hero of the hour. He had thrashed the
bully of the school, and from that moment he was
the idol of his schoolmates and the most popular
boy in Cleverly.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">HERBERT FINDS HIMSELF THE INNOCENT CAUSE OF MUCH TROUBLE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Herbert Harkins reached home he found
that the story of his battle with Arthur Black had
preceded him. His mother was at the doorway
awaiting his arrival. She scanned his face anxiously.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Herbert?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not a great deal, mother,” he said, with a trace
of conscious pride in his voice; “but I can’t say
as much for the other fellow.”</p>

<p>“I was sorry to hear that you were quarreling,”
she remarked gravely; “it’s not gentlemanly.”</p>

<p>“But I could not let the other boys think I was
a coward,” he cried quickly.</p>

<p>His mother made no reply to this, but pointing
toward the sitting room, said simply:</p>

<p>“Your father is waiting to see you.”</p>

<p>Herbert started up the stairway, filled with misgivings.
It was a rare thing for his father to send
for him, and the serious manner in which his mother
had delivered the message convinced him that it<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
must be a matter of importance. David Harkins
was above everything else a just man. He had
started out in life with bright prospects, but through
a series of misfortunes over which he had no control,
his little fortune had been very much reduced
and his health greatly impaired.</p>

<p>His doctor advised him to go into the country
and engage in open air work as much as possible.
He cautioned him above all else to avoid the occasions
of excitement. The medical man assured
him that his heart was weak, and that it would not
stand any severe or unusual strain. Mr. Harkins
examined various properties in the vicinity of the
city, and finally decided upon the neat little place
at Cleverly. It contained a garden and was within
a reasonable distance of the city whence Mr. Harkins’
employment called him several times a week.
In the meantime he cultivated the garden, and by
dint of close economy managed to make both ends
meet. Mr. Harkins was engaged in looking over
some papers when Herbert entered the room. He
laid them down immediately and turned to the boy
with a look in which affection and reproach were
mingled.</p>

<p>“Herbert, I hear bad reports about you.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for that, father,” was the response,
“because I don’t believe I deserve them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harkins glanced at Herbert keenly, and the<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
look which he received in return seemed to satisfy
him, for he said:</p>

<p>“Tell me in your own way all about this quarrel&mdash;give
me all the details, and do not attempt to hide
anything.”</p>

<p>Herbert told everything clearly and quickly. As
he concluded his father nodded his head as if to indicate
that he understood and then sighed deeply.
Herbert noticed this, and said with trembling voice:</p>

<p>“You believe me, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I did right?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“But why are you so sad?”</p>

<p>“Because I regret this thing very much&mdash;because
I am sorry you quarreled with Arthur Black.”</p>

<p>“But you said I was justified.”</p>

<p>“I did; but unfortunately you have offended a
powerful man. I suppose you are old enough to
understand these things. John Black, Arthur’s
father, is not only the richest man in Cleverly, but
he is the president of the bank, and I&mdash;I owe him
money.”</p>

<p>David Harkins put his head in his hands as he
spoke, and leaning on his desk, sat there for some
time buried in thought. Herbert was silent for
awhile, then rushing up to his father, cried out impulsively:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, father; I didn’t intend to
do anything wrong. I never thought of injuring
you. If I can repair the damage in any way I’ll be
only too glad to do so. Tell me what to do.”</p>

<p>“Do,” cried his father, with a sudden return of
his natural dignity; “why do nothing; you are
guilty of no wrong and have nothing to regret.
However,” with a sigh which he could not conceal,
“I’m sure we will hear more about this before the
evening is over.”</p>

<p>And so they did. About eight o’clock that night
there was a loud rapping at the door, and a stout,
pompous man was ushered into the parlor. He had
iron gray hair, heavy bristling eyebrows and scowled
in the most severe manner. He looked about the
little room in a disdainful manner, and then dropped
abruptly into the easiest chair at hand. His manner
was aggressive. He carried a heavy cane and
pounded it on the floor impatiently while awaiting
the arrival of Mr. Harkins.</p>

<p>Such was John Black, bank president, capitalist
and the most unpopular man in Cleverly.</p>

<p>“See here, Harkins,” he cried out abruptly as
Herbert’s father entered the room, “I came to see
you about that boy of yours.”</p>

<p>“What about him?” asked Mr. Harkins quietly.</p>

<p>“A great deal about him,” spluttered the banker,
“he’s a young rowdy; that’s what he is. He set<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
on my boy Arthur at school to-day and beat him
in the most brutal manner.”</p>

<p>“A boys’ fight?” queried Herbert’s father lifting
his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“You may call it a boys’ fight,” thundered the
other; “I call it an outrage. Why that child of
mine came home with his nose bleeding&mdash;do you
understand sir&mdash;with his nose bleeding.”</p>

<p>“That child as you call him,” ventured Mr. Harkins,
a note of amusement in his voice, “is, I believe,
nearly seventeen years old.”</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with it?” shouted the
other.</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that he’s nearly two years older
than my boy.”</p>

<p>“Age is not the only thing&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” interrupted Mr. Harkins, “weight should
be considered. Arthur is not only older, but he
is much heavier than Herbert.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” exclaimed the banker in
amazement, “that you are taking up for that boy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Mr. Harkins pleasantly, “that’s
not necessary. Herbert seems to be fully capable
of taking up for himself.”</p>

<p>“Take care, Harkins,” said the rich man, banging
his cane angrily on the floor; “take care; don’t
attempt to trifle with me!”</p>

<p>David Harkins paid no attention to this outburst,<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
but sat silent wondering what would come next.
His curiosity was soon satisfied.</p>

<p>John Black arose with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“There is no need of my wasting any more time
here,” he exclaimed. “I came over to give you a
chance to set yourself straight.”</p>

<p>“To set myself straight?” queried Harkins.</p>

<p>“Yes; if you have that boy of yours apologize to
Arthur at school to-morrow, we’ll call it quits.”</p>

<p>David Harkins stood looking at the banker as if
he had taken leave of his senses. The silence lasted
so long that it became embarrassing.</p>

<p>“Come, come, what do you say to my proposal?”
asked John Black. “I don’t want to be too hard on
your young one. Do as I say and the matter will
drop. Your answer.”</p>

<p>“No!” shouted Harkins. “No; a hundred
times no! Herbert did perfectly right in thrashing
that bully of a son of yours. I’m proud of him
for doing it. And if he would dare to apologize
for it I’d disown him as a son.”</p>

<p>John Black grew almost livid with rage. He
hurried to the door. When he reached it he looked
back and shook his cane at Harkins.</p>

<p>“You will regret this insult; blast you, I’ll make
you sorry for what you said.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Harkins entered the room just as the banker
retired. She hurried over to her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>“I heard loud voices, David,” she said. “I am
sorry you quarreled with Mr. Black.”</p>

<p>Her husband looked at her fondly. His face was
pale, although he was smiling.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, too,” he said; “but he irritated me
beyond endurance. Besides I told him the truth.
Between ourselves,” he added, “I’m really proud of
Herbert.”</p>

<p>“But you must not tell that to Herbert,” she said
anxiously; “it might be the means of spoiling him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never fear, I won’t tell him; but I won’t
be unjust to the boy either. I’ll deal fairly with
him.”</p>

<p>Indeed, as has already been indicated, a love of
justice was one of the most striking traits of David
Harkins’ character, and unconsciously he was doing
all in his power to plant the same virtue in the
mind and heart of his only son.</p>

<p>“In spite of what you say, David,” remarked
Mrs. Harkins, “I regret this incident. I do not believe
in signs or any nonsense of that sort, but some
strange voice within me says that this thing will
have a fatal ending.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cheer up,” was the bright response of the
husband. “It’s folly to look on the dark side of
life. Anyhow, what will be, must be. All that
we can do in this life is to try and live decently. A
friend of mine used to say that it was a good thing<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
always to hope for the best and prepare for the
worst.”</p>

<p>With this bit of philosophy Mr. Harkins turned
to his desk and resumed his work. As his wife
closed the door, however, the cheerful look left his
face, and lines of care and worry began to appear.
Despite his protests to the contrary, he regretted his
encounter with John Black. But his sense of right
and justice was too acute to permit him to make
peace at the price of truth.</p>

<p>While he was thinking over the events of the day,
there was a ring of the door-bell, and in a moment
Mrs. Harkins appeared to present Mr. Horace
Coke, the lawyer of Cleverly and one of the good
friends of the family. Mr. Coke was one of the
old fashioned attorneys at law. He wore a suit of
black broadcloth and carried a cane and a high silk
hat in his hand. He had a smooth, round face, was
always in a good humor, loved children and dogs,
and lived in constant peace and harmony with his
friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>Mr. Harkins hastened to give him the most comfortable
chair in the room, and Mrs. Harkins, who
had remained, waited expectantly to hear the occasion
of the visit. The visitor stroked his chin in
an absent-minded way and seemed ill at ease. He
was not smiling either, which was a strange thing
for Horace Coke. Presently he said abruptly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a lovely evening Dave, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mr. Harkins, “it is a lovely evening.”</p>

<p>But he knew in his heart that the lawyer had not
called to make this useless comment on the weather.
He knew that something more important was to
come, so he sat silent and waited.</p>

<p>“Dave,” said the lawyer, clearing his throat,
“I’m here on a very, very unpleasant errand. It
was in the line of my professional duty though, and
I couldn’t get out of it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” was the non-committal reply.</p>

<p>“No,” pursued Mr. Coke, “you see I am here
representing a client.”</p>

<p>“Might I ask the name of your client?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is John Black.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harkins started as he heard this name. It
was not altogether unexpected, yet the sound gave
him an uncomfortable feeling. Mrs. Harkins, too,
was very much depressed by the announcement.
Herbert had entered the room quietly during the
conversation; but when he heard what Mr. Coke
had said, he paused at the threshold.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Harkins finally, “what about
Mr. Black?”</p>

<p>“It seems,” replied the lawyer, “that you have
had a financial transaction with Mr. Black.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>“That he has your note for one thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“That is correct.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Black sends me here to collect it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Coke, isn’t this a rather unusual method of
doing business? I borrowed this money from Mr.
Black at the bank to pay off the mortgage on my
house. I understood that it was to run for several
years, although we had no written agreement regarding
the time. But I never heard of a banker
sending a lawyer to collect a note.”</p>

<p>“It is unusual,” confessed the lawyer, “but Mr.
Black has the legal right to do it if he sees fit. He
says the endorsers of the note are no good and he
instructs me, if payment is not made within twenty-four
hours, to proceed against you.”</p>

<p>He arose to go. As he reached the door he
turned and said:</p>

<p>“Dave, I don’t think this is a square deal; but
I’m only acting as a lawyer for a client. If I had
the money to spare, I’d give it to you myself.”</p>

<p>He said good-night and departed. Mrs. Harkins
turned to her husband.</p>

<p>“Can you meet this demand, Dave?”</p>

<p>He looked at her in a strained sort of way. It
was a half minute before he spoke. He said simply:</p>

<p>“I haven’t the faintest idea where I am going
to get the money.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">PROVING THAT BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert was deeply impressed with the scene
that had taken place between his father and Mr.
Coke. It was quite early in the evening, and putting
on his hat and coat, he quietly left the house for
the purpose of taking a walk around the town and
thinking over the meaning of the events which were
following each other so quickly. He was filled with
remorse at the thought of having been the innocent
cause of bringing disaster on their modest household;
but deep down in his heart he felt that he
had done the right thing in spite of the unexpected
results that had followed. Herbert had always
been a sturdy and resolute boy.</p>

<p>He had regard for the feelings and rights of
others, but was always quick to resent any attempt
to impose upon his own good nature. When he
first entered the school at Cleverly he did not give
promise of being a very bright pupil. In fact there
were times when the teacher was disposed to consider
him a very dull boy; but little by little the<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
ability that slumbered with him was awakened, and
by degrees he began to show evidences of more
than ordinary talent. He was not quick to learn;
but was always numbered among the plodders at
the school. In spite of his apparent slowness, he
began to advance in his classes, and when he had
reached his sixteenth year was near the head of the
boys in his grade. For one thing he retained the
knowledge that he acquired with so much labor.
He had what the teacher called bull-dog tenacity.
In other words, when he started out to accomplish
a certain task he never rested till it was entirely completed.</p>

<p>Mr. Harkins, who was a man of very unusual
ability, was extremely anxious to give his son the
very best education in his power. His ambition was
to develop Herbert both morally and mentally, and
he looked forward with great hope to the time
when he would finish his tuition at the Cleverly
district school. After that it was his wish that he
should enter St. Joseph’s College in the adjoining
city, in order to obtain a higher education. The
Jesuits who were in charge of that institution, had
offered four free scholarships to the boys who obtained
the highest average in a competitive examination
that was to be held in the spring of the year.
The father and son had frequently discussed this
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>“Herbert,” said Mr. Harkins, “this is no child’s
play. If you make up your mind to go into this
thing, it will mean hard work. There will be very
little time for sports.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate that, father,” Herbert would say
soberly. “And when the time comes I intend to
pin myself down to the hardest kind of work. I
know what it means, and I have no fear of the result.”</p>

<p>So it was that the boy trudged along in his somewhat
heavy way, doing the routine that fell to all
the pupils of the Cleverly School. While he did
not display any special flashes of brilliancy, his
averages were always good, and sometimes unusually
large.</p>

<p>Arthur Black was the opposite of Herbert in almost
every way. For years he had been one of the
favored pupils at the Cleverly School. The fact
that his father was rich and influential made all
those connected with the school disposed to treat
him with more than ordinary consideration. He
was a bright boy, but extremely indolent; and as a
consequence was a source of constant trouble to his
teachers. Arthur had the faculty of being able to
recite his lessons without having given much time
to their study; but as the weeks and months went
by he became more and more indifferent and finally
drifted down near the rear of his class where he bid<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
fair to remain until the end of his school days.
Arthur was very much annoyed at the progress
made by Herbert Harkins, and publicly said that
it was due to the fact that Herbert was one of the
teacher’s favorites. No charge could be more unfair
than this, but it was circulated through the
town, much to the annoyance of Herbert and his
parents.</p>

<p>Herbert thought of all these things as he made
his way along the main street of the town. He was
filled with an intense desire to assist his father, and
in a vague sort of way wondered whether it would
not be a good thing to leave school and go to work
for that purpose. The thought was worth considering
anyhow, and he made up his mind to speak
to his father before he left home the next morning.
Just as he reached the post office pavement, he
noticed a small group of men and boys standing
there engaged in an animated discussion. As he
approached nearer, he saw Arthur Black and a
friend of his named Harry Adler talking for the
benefit of the crowd. Adler was many years the
senior of both Herbert and Arthur. He had the
reputation of being a very worthless boy, and although
he was rapidly approaching manhood he
gave no indication of changing his habits. He was
a type of many other boys who can be described
in a single sentence as cigarette smoking youths who<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
will not work. He said on one occasion that he
was too proud to do menial labor, but in spite of
this he was not ashamed to live off the small earnings
of a poor mother who was compelled to take
in sewing in order to feed and clothe the members
of her family. Adler had persistently refused to
go to school, and only two years before had run
away from home and made his way by degrees to
New York City. He remained there for several
weeks, and then wrote begging letters home asking
for sufficient money to pay his carfare back to
Cleverly. He did not even have the manliness to
be ashamed of this incident, but looked upon it as
one of the big achievements in his life. Ever after
that he stood on the street corners and talked in a
loud way about his adventures in the big city, much
to the amazement and interest of the small boys who
stood with open mouths and eagerly listened to all
that he had to say.</p>

<p>As Herbert reached the group he heard Arthur
Black detailing the story of the fight at the schoolhouse.
He informed his hearers that Herbert was
a sneaking busybody, and that after school was over
he had given him the punishment he so richly deserved.</p>

<p>“But when my back was turned,” he said, “that
rascal of a Herbert Harkins gave me a blow in the
face that made my nose bleed. He wouldn’t dare<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
to have done it if we had been standing face to
face.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Herbert to stand, and
turning toward the crowd with flashing eyes, he
cried out:</p>

<p>“The story that Arthur Black has told you isn’t
true. He was the one at fault, and as far as the
fight was concerned I think his nose and the color
of his eyes tell the story of the battle better than
I can.”</p>

<p>Adler interrupted Herbert at this point to say in a
sneering tone:</p>

<p>“See here, young man, if it comes to a question
of truth between you and Arthur Black, the people
of this town will believe Arthur.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” retorted Herbert
angrily. “Anyhow I would be willing to leave it
to the people that know us both.”</p>

<p>The minute Herbert had spoken he was sorry that
his impulsive nature had led him into the conversation.
In order to avoid any further trouble he
hurried away; but Arthur Black and Harry Adler
did not propose to let him off so easily.</p>

<p>“Hello there, little boy,” cried Adler in a taunting
voice. “Are you going to run away again, just
as you did this afternoon?”</p>

<p>Herbert made no reply, but kept on his way.
Then Arthur Black joined in the conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“He’d better run away,” he said, “if he knows
which side his bread is buttered on. I want to tell
you, Herbert Harkins, that you are going to suffer
for daring to insult me. You say you won the
fight this afternoon. Well, if you did, it will be the
dearest victory you ever bought. Before another
day goes by you will find that your whole family is
likely to be thrown out into the street, and that you
will be on your way to the poorhouse, where you belong.
Perhaps you won’t be so ready to meddle
next time.”</p>

<p>Herbert halted instantly. He hurried back to
where the others were standing and made towards
Arthur Black. Just as he passed by, Adler quietly
slipped his right foot out on the sidewalk, and Herbert
tripping over it, fell at full length on the pavement.
He jumped up smarting with anger and the
shock of the fall. He rushed toward Adler, but
in the twinkling of an eye, before a blow had been
struck, his mind reverted to the scene that had taken
place at his home only a short while before. Instantly
he was filled with remorse. He realized
that it would be most unfortunate for him to get
into a street brawl at a time like this. He felt confident
of his ability to chastise both Arthur Black
and Harry Adler; but he realized the scene that it
would cause and the possibility of one or all of them
being taken up by the town constable; so without<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
any explanation whatever he lowered his arms and
walked down the street again.</p>

<p>Adler turned to Arthur Black with a sneer on his
lips.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve got that fellow sized up all
right,” he said. “He’s a coward; he’s afraid to
fight.”</p>

<p>Herbert heard this with burning cheeks. He hurried
on his way home, stopping to look neither to
the right nor to the left. His mind was filled with
conflicting emotions. He thought of the threat that
hung over his father, and of the reflection that had
been made upon his own personal courage; but try
as he would he could not get the sound of that word
“coward” out of his ears.</p>

<p>When he reached home the sense of shame had
grown so strong that he could not stand the strain
any longer. He halted on the doorstep irresolute.
The next moment he turned on his heel and walked
back to the corner where he had met Arthur Black
and Harry Adler. Black had left, but Adler was
still there entertaining some of the smaller boys
with stories of his own greatness. Herbert walked
up to him with flashing eyes:</p>

<p>“Adler, I’ve got a crow to pick with you.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead with the picking,” sneered the older
boy, and Herbert flushed hotly at the contemptuous
tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>“A few minutes ago you referred to me as a
coward.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“I want you to take that word back; I won’t
stand for it.”</p>

<p>Adler broke out into a coarse laugh.</p>

<p>“Why, the little fellow is feeling his oats,” he
cried; “he looks like a bantam rooster.”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I look like,” retorted Herbert
hotly. “I want to know whether you’ll take that
word back.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited, little chap.”</p>

<p>“Will you take it back? Say yes or no!” demanded
Herbert.</p>

<p>“I say no,” drawled Adler.</p>

<p>“Then I say take that!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Herbert reached up and gave the
fellow a resounding slap on the cheek. Adler was
so dazed at the unexpected assault that he stood
still gazing stupidly at his assailant. The small
boys in the group were secretly delighted at the
indignity put upon their worthless companion, but
were discreetly silent. Herbert walked off tingling
with delight at having satisfied his outraged feelings.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH FORTUNE UNEXPECTEDLY FAVORS DAVID HARKINS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert Harkins prepared to go to bed that
night with a very heavy heart. He could not rid
himself of the notion that he was the cause of the
troubles that were gathering so rapidly about their
home. Sleep is said to be the best medicine for a
troubled mind; but unfortunately Herbert was not
able to go to sleep. Usually he was in the land of
dreams as soon as his head touched the pillow, but
this night he was afflicted with a peculiar nervousness
that could not be overcome. More than this
he was greatly disturbed over the agitated condition
of his father. He knew that he was sitting
at his desk in the front room downstairs. He had
spoken to him when he came home, and now from
the light that was shining up the stairway he knew
that his father was still awake. Presently he heard
the movement of a chair, and then the steady tramping
of feet indicating that Mr. Harkins was walking
up and down the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly this monotonous sound was broken by<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
a sharp rap on the front door. Herbert heard his
father respond to the summons. The bolt was
drawn back, the door opened, and then came a
sound like the cry of recognition from two men.
The door was softly closed again, and then came
the steady mumbling of voices. This continued so
long that Herbert became frightened. He got out
of bed in the dark, and going into the hallway crept
downstairs silently, step by step, until he had reached
the doorway leading into the parlor. The light was
turned down and the room was quite dim; but he
could see his father and another man seated at a
table engaged in earnest conversation. The
stranger wore a full beard, and his head was covered
with a great shock of red hair, in much disorder.
The two men were so much engaged that they did
not notice the half frightened boy standing near
the doorway. Herbert on his part was so much interested
in what he saw that for the time being he
forgot the situation in which he had placed himself.</p>

<p>At times the two men were so close together
that it would hardly have been possible to have
drawn a sheet of paper between them. The
stranger, in order to illustrate some point that he
was making in his talk, threw his arm violently in
the air, and in doing so overturned a little China
ornament that was on the table, sending it crashing
to the floor. Both men started violently at this<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
unexpected happening, and then glanced nervously
around the room as if to see whether anyone were
listening. At the first sound of the falling ornament,
Herbert started to run upstairs; but when the
conversation was resumed some strange power
seemed to draw him back to the doorway again.
His intention was to take one last look and go
away. He knew that he had no right there, and
that his father might be very angry if he thought
that he was out of bed and listening to the conversation;
but some strange will over which he appeared
to be powerless, kept him rooted to the spot.
The two men talked in such a low tone at first that
all he could hear was the mumbling of voices.
Presently, however, his father becoming more earnest,
said excitedly to the other man in a louder
voice:</p>

<p>“I won’t do it. I tell you I can’t do it. It’s not
right to you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool,” responded the red-haired man
in a deep bass voice. “This will save you, and it
cannot do me any harm. I’ll never miss it, I can
assure you.”</p>

<p>“But it seems so unjust,” urged his father; “it
doesn’t seem quite square to act with you in this
way. After all these years I should not be placed
in the position of taking this from you.”</p>

<p>“I am the best judge of that,” growled the other<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
man in his heavy voice; “take it and say no more
about it.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he pushed a package in the direction
of Mr. Harkins, who still with reluctance, picked it
up and placed it in his pocket. This act seemed to
relieve his feelings, because he said right away in a
voice that sounded lighter and more contented:</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it is all for the best. I’ll take it,
and you can rest assured that you’ll lose nothing by
your kindness.”</p>

<p>Their voices became lower again at this point,
and Herbert, sorry for having remained so long,
hurried back to bed and was soon in the land of
slumber. Father, mother and son met at the breakfast
table the next morning, and all seemed to be
in a more cheerful frame of mind than they had
been for some days. Mr. Harkins was bubbling
over with good spirits. He turned to his wife in a
laughing manner, and said:</p>

<p>“I’ve got a surprise for you this morning&mdash;a
bit of good news that will make you feel good.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the wife curiously.</p>

<p>“Simply that I have the money and I am going
to pay off that obligation to John Black before the
clock strikes another hour.”</p>

<p>The poor woman was so overjoyed at this unexpected
news that she ran over and gave her husband
a hearty kiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>“This is good news, David,” she said. “How
on earth did you manage to raise the money in
such a short time?”</p>

<p>“Oh ho!” he replied merrily; “it’s news you
are after, is it? Well you can’t have it just now.
This money came from a gentleman who is a very
good friend of mine. His name will have to remain
a secret for the present at least.”</p>

<p>Herbert sat and listened to this conversation with
a feeling of dismay. He felt like crying out and
telling his father that he had been present at the
mysterious midnight interview and had heard things
that were not intended for his ears; but his lips
refused to frame the words, and he sat there feeling
very mean and very guilty. Finally both conscience
and curiosity got the better of him. He made up
his mind to confess his little indiscretion&mdash;for it
was not anything more serious than an indiscretion&mdash;and
then to ask his father to tell him the name of
the strange man who had appeared at such an unusual
hour and under such unusual circumstances.
Mr. Harkins had his hat and coat on preparing to
leave the house when Herbert arose from the table
and said to him in a voice that quivered with nervousness:</p>

<p>“Father, I could not sleep last night.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to hear that, my son,” was the
kindly reply. “Probably you are not feeling well.<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
You had better stop in and see Dr. Smith on your
way from school this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“No, no; it’s not that,” stammered Herbert; “it’s
something I want to tell you. When I found that
I could not sleep I got out of bed&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am in a hurry now, Herbert,” exclaimed his
father, talking very rapidly and moving towards the
door. “I must get down and see Mr. Coke. You
can tell me this story when you come home from
school this afternoon.”</p>

<p>And the next moment the street door closed with
a bang and Mr. Harkness was on his way to the
bank. Herbert sat down in a chair feeling very
much disappointed. He felt somehow or other that
his father had become involved, and if he had been
able to speak, that much mystery might have been
dissipated.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH DAVID HARKINS BECOMES THE VICTIM OF PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>David Harkins left his home that morning,
walking rapidly and gaily humming a tune to himself.
He felt better and happier than he had for
many weeks before. The thought of canceling the
note and freeing himself from the obligation which
he was under to John Black lifted an immense
weight from his mind and enabled him to take a
cheerful view of life. As he walked along he mentally
matured plans for increasing his income during
the year to come and placing his family in a position
where they would not be compelled to feel
concerned regarding the future.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he reached the office of Horace
Coke, the lawyer, who was installed in a little second
story room of a modest house on the main
street. The apartment was very much like the
lawyer&mdash;simple and old-fashioned, but entirely
adequate for the needs of the law. There was a
plain, flat-top desk, littered with legal papers. An
office boy who hoped eventually to become a member<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
of the bar, sat copying a deed; and the silence
in the room was broken by the steady scratching
of his pen. The shelves about the room were filled
with law books covered with calfskin and bearing
their titles in little gold letters on a slip of black over
what might be called their backbones. Mr. Coke
himself was puffing away at a big black cigar&mdash;which,
by the way, was his only dissipation. He
was looking over some papers when David Harkins
entered the room, but jumped from his chair immediately
and greeted the newcomer with a hearty:</p>

<p>“Hello there, Dave! What’s bringing you out
so early in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Some legal business, Horace,” replied the other
laughingly.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that,” said the venerable attorney,
shaking his head in a doubtful manner. “I
always advise my friends to keep out of the law.
It’s a bad business. It takes up all your money, and
rarely gives you any good results.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like queer talk for a man who depends
on the law for his livelihood.”</p>

<p>Horace Coke laughed heartily at this retort, and
said:</p>

<p>“It does sound queer, doesn’t it? But I don’t
talk that way to everybody. Of course, if people
will get into trouble and will invoke the law, I
might as well take their money and attend to their<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
business as the next one; but I satisfy my conscience
by advising all of my friends to keep out of the law,
because as I said before, it’s a mighty bad business.”</p>

<p>Then the good-natured counsellor dropped into
his chair and indulged in another hearty laugh. It
was one of the oddities of his nature that he should
be continually berating the profession of which he
was such an ornament and for which he really had
a deep reverence.</p>

<p>“But not to get off the subject,” added Mr. Harkins,
“I would like to inform you that I have come
here to pay off that note to John Black. Under
ordinary circumstances I would go to the bank to
transact this business; but as long as Mr. Black has
found it necessary to employ a lawyer to secure his
money, I felt that it was proper to come here and
pay you.”</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at David Harkins searchingly
through his eye-glasses. He was silent for a moment,
and then said in a low voice, in marked contrast
with his jolly manner of a few minutes before:</p>

<p>“See here, Dave, can you spare this money? I
don’t believe you can, and I hate to see a man
pressed. If you say the word, I’ll go over to old
Black and try to get an extension on the note.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” was the cheerful rejoinder. “I
do not desire an extension; I want to pay it and
get it off my mind forever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Coke walked over to Harkins and taking him
by the hand, exclaimed in his cheery voice:</p>

<p>“Congratulations, old man! I am glad to hear
you talk in that way, and I am mighty glad to know
that you were able to raise the money in such a
short time. It will not only be a good thing to pay
off the note, but it will be the means of establishing
your credit in Cleverly. There’s nothing like
a reputation for a man, and if you can get a good
one it is liable to stick to you just as well as a bad
one.”</p>

<p>The two men sat down at the desk together, and
after the necessary papers had been prepared and
signed, Mr. Harkins handed over one thousand dollars
in fresh banknotes.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the lawyer put his hat and
coat on and started towards the bank where he had
an appointment with John Black. The door was
closed when he arrived; but following his usual
custom he entered without knocking. The banker’s
back was turned to him at the time, and when he
heard the door open and close, Mr. Black cried out
in a harsh voice:</p>

<p>“Who’s that? What are you doing there?”</p>

<p>“It is only I, John,” said the lawyer. “I came
here to attend to a little matter of business.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the banker, changing his tone
slightly at the sight of the lawyer. “I thought it<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
was one of those impudent clerks coming in here
without being civil enough to knock at the door.”</p>

<p>After this he started to walk up and down the
office, stamping his feet and frowning in a very ugly
manner. His expression was forbidding, and Mr.
Coke looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Black?” asked the lawyer.
“You don’t seem to be in a very good humor this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Good humor? I should say not. I’ve got a
good notion to leave this town. A man’s property
isn’t safe over night. You get no protection. You
pay big taxes and put up with all sorts of inconveniences,
and what do you get in return? That’s
what I would like to know; what do you get in return?”</p>

<p>“Why what in the world are you driving at?”
asked the lawyer; “what has happened?”</p>

<p>“Happened? Why everything’s happened. Some
thief entered my house last night, got into the
library, broke open my desk and stole a package
of money that I had put there for safe keeping over
night. What do you think of that? Wouldn’t
you say that something had happened if your house
had been broken into and your desk had been
rifled? Wouldn’t you, I say? Wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said the lawyer, staring at his
client. “I suppose I should say that something had<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
happened under those circumstances. But have you
any clue to the robbery?”</p>

<p>“Clue! Clue!” retorted the banker, with his
habit of repeating words. “Certainly not. How
could you expect me to have a clue in a town like
this? The police officials are no good, never were
any good, and never will be any good.”</p>

<p>“But have you any hope of recovering your
money?”</p>

<p>“Hope? Certainly I have hope. I am going to
recover that money if it costs every other cent that
I have in the world. I don’t propose to sit down
like a lamb and be fleeced. Do you think that I am
that kind of a man? Do you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the lawyer, “I do not. I am very
sorry to hear about your loss; but I don’t suppose
there is any use crying over spilt milk.”</p>

<p>“Spilt milk! What do you mean by that?
How can you talk about a large amount of money
as if it were spilt milk? What do you mean anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the lawyer, “that was simply a little
illustration of mine. You see the moral is a good
one.”</p>

<p>“Hump! I don’t think it’s good at all, and I
don’t like to hear you talk in that way.” Then after
a momentary pause, “But what is it you want?
Why did you come here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>“I came with some good news,” said the lawyer.
“David Harkins called on me this morning and
paid off that note of a thousand dollars, and I have
brought the money to you.”</p>

<p>The crafty face of the banker lighted up with
surprise at this announcement. It was so unexpected
that he hardly knew what to say in reply.
Finally he managed to remark:</p>

<p>“Paid you? Paid you this morning, did he? I
wonder where he got the money.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I do not know,” said the lawyer,
“and really I don’t think it makes much difference
as long as you get the amount of your note.”</p>

<p>The two men sat down at the desk together, and
the lawyer, after some preliminary remarks, handed
over the money to the banker. The minute it was
laid before him he jumped with a start.</p>

<p>“Why, this is all new money,” he exclaimed.
“That’s just the kind of money that was taken from
me last night. I don’t believe Dave Harkins came
by that money honestly. It makes him look like a
thief. It was probably done by that smart boy of
his.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say that,” cried the lawyer, trying
to pacify the banker.</p>

<p>“But I will say it. Both father and son have a
grudge against me, and I don’t believe they would
hesitate at anything to get even.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>“But my dear sir,” remarked the lawyer in a
soothing tone, “you have made a very rash assertion,
and you have absolutely nothing to base it
upon.”</p>

<p>John Black was silent for a moment, and then suddenly
turning around, he said in a harsh tone:</p>

<p>“Did you get that money direct from David Harkins?”</p>

<p>“I did,” was the response.</p>

<p>“Then,” exclaimed the banker in a tone of triumph,
“that proves my suspicion. The money that
was taken out of my desk consisted of ten $100 bills,
and the money you have just given me is made up
exactly of ten $100 bills. That satisfies me.”</p>

<p>“It is a coincidence,” admitted the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Coincidence,” snorted the banker, “it’s sufficient
to convict the man. It satisfies me, and it
ought to be enough to satisfy any other man with
brains.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be too hasty,” suggested the lawyer.
“There is nothing to be gained by acting in that
manner.”</p>

<p>“Hasty? Don’t talk about being hasty. I am
going to have justice no matter who is injured;
and I don’t want to be soft-soaped out of doing the
right thing. I am going to act, and I am going to
act quickly.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir,” said the lawyer, persisting in<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
his objections, “you must have proof; don’t you
understand that? You must have proof before you
can accuse a man.”</p>

<p>John Black was in a terrible rage by this time.
He paced up and down the office rapidly, and then
standing in front of the lawyer and raising his
finger in a threatening way, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I’ll have proof all right. The proof will be a
warrant for the arrest of David Harkins on the
charge of stealing my money.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear you talk that way,” said the
lawyer, “I think you are making a mistake. But,
however, you are master of your own actions.
When do you propose to do this?”</p>

<p>“Within twenty-four hours,” replied the other
solemnly. “If you want to, you can serve a warning
on Dave Harkins, and if he will restore my
money at once I may be merciful to him; but if
not, he must take the consequences. In any event
he will have to make up his mind within the next
twenty-four hours.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH DAVID HARKINS QUITS THIS LIFE AND TAKES HIS SECRET WITH HIM</span></h2>
</div>


<p>News travels quickly in a small town. Before
breakfast the following morning it was very generally
reported that John Black had been robbed,
and that he was going to issue a warrant for the
arrest of David Harkins. The report shocked most
of those who heard it. John Black was a hard man,
and more than one of the citizens of Cleverly had
felt the force of his iron hand.</p>

<p>He worked incessantly, and never spent a penny
unless it was absolutely necessary. Such a man
may be considered just; but he is bound to be unpopular.
David Harkins, on the contrary, was well
liked by all who knew him. He was on the best
of terms with his neighbors, and always had time
for a kind word to everyone he met&mdash;man, woman
and child.</p>

<p>The people therefore were disposed to suspend
judgment until they had heard both sides of the
story. While David Harkins was at the table Horace
Coke drove up, and asked to have a minute’s<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
conversation. As soon as they were alone he said
hastily:</p>

<p>“Have you heard the rumors?”</p>

<p>“I have,” responded Harkins, “and I consider
them scandalous. I wonder where such malicious
stories could originate?”</p>

<p>“That’s easily told,” replied the lawyer. “They
come from no less a person than John Black.”</p>

<p>“How dare he say such things!” exclaimed Harkins
with passion.</p>

<p>For answer the lawyer told him the details of his
interview with the banker and the singular likeness
between the banknotes that had been stolen and the
money which had been used to pay off the note.</p>

<p>David Harkins listened in astonishment, and when
Coke had concluded, said:</p>

<p>“But even that doesn’t justify Black in slandering
me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; but you must agree that the coincidence
is not only remarkable, but could be construed
as suspicious.”</p>

<p>“But my part of the transaction was perfectly
straight.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of that,” responded Coke with fervor,
“and that’s why I’m here this morning. Let me
state the case in a nutshell. You have been foolish
enough to make an enemy of a powerful and wealthy
man. You have borrowed money of him. He demands<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
the payment of the money from you in the
belief that you are penniless and cannot comply with
his demand. His house is entered and robbed of a
thousand dollars. The next morning you pay him
a thousand dollars in bills identical to those stolen
from him.”</p>

<p>“But there are thousands of such bills in circulation.”</p>

<p>“True; but the thing for you to do is to shut
the mouth of gossip at once. That can be done in
a very simple manner. All you have to do is to
prove what is known in the law as an alibi. Tell
where you got the money and produce the man who
gave it to you.”</p>

<p>Harkins shook his head sadly at this.</p>

<p>“Your suggestion seems simple enough; but I
fear I cannot comply with it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” in manifest astonishment.</p>

<p>“Because it was given to me in confidence and
with the understanding that the name of the donor
should not be divulged.”</p>

<p>“But it came from a friend?”</p>

<p>“One of the best I have in the world.”</p>

<p>“Well, he would surely not permit you to rest
under a shadow for the sake of a foolish promise.
Go to him at once and get a release from your pledge
to silence.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s too late,” said Harkins gravely.<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
“He was to start for England this very day. However,
your advice is good. I’ll hire a team and try
to reach him. If I succeed I will report to you this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Coke departed, Herbert made an
effort to tell his father the story of his indiscretion
in listening at the doorway on the occasion of the
midnight visit of the mysterious stranger. But
once again Mr. Harkins was too busy to stop and
listen, and father and son parted without that exchange
of confidence which would have done so
much to clear up an embarrassing situation. Mr.
Harkins went to the nearest livery stable and soon
had a one-horse buggy harnessed and ready for
the road. He told no one his destination, but
whipping up the horse, passed down the main streets,
out into the outskirts of the town and was soon lost
to view.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when he returned, and
then the wheels of the carriage were covered with
mud and the horse was covered with lather as if he
had traveled far and fast that day. There was a
careworn look about David Harkins’ eyes and a
drooping of the lips that betokened disappointment.
He drove back over the same streets whence he had
taken his departure in the morning, nodding pleasantly
to several acquaintances he passed on the way.</p>

<p>Just when he was in sight of the livery stable, a<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
sudden gust of wind raised a cloud of dust that
blinded animals and pedestrians alike. This was
followed by another, and the second squall carried
in its wake a batch of old newspapers and sent them
eddying about in the air like some strange craft in
a whirlpool. One of the papers struck the horse
square in the eye. The animal, already frightened
by the wind and dust, raised up on its haunches
and gave a shrill neigh. Harkins grasping the
reins tightly, pulled it down to earth again. But
the moment the horse’s feet struck the ground it
darted off like a flash and went tearing down the
street at an insane gait. The driver kept cool and
self contained. Standing on the floor of the carriage
and leaning over the dashboard he pulled at
the lines with all his strength.</p>

<p>Just when he felt that the animal was being
brought into subjection, the lines gave a snap and
broke, leaving him thrown back on the seat with
two useless bits of leather in his hand. He was as
helpless as a seaman without a rudder, or more so.
The horse released from the grasp of the driver,
redoubled its speed and kept on its way like mad.
Harkins, now alarmed, considered the advisability
of jumping out of the vehicle in order to avert a
worse fate. But while he was debating the situation
the horse solved it for him. Coming to a cross
street it swerved in its furious career and turned<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
the corner. The suddenness of the move swung
the buggy from one side of the street to the other,
and on its rebound it struck an iron lamp-post,
smashing the frail vehicle to pieces and throwing
David Harkins head first on to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>A crowd collected immediately and several men
hurried to the assistance of the stricken man. He
was insensible, and his breath came in short, sharp
gasps. A stretcher was procured, and he was carried
to his home. A physician was telephoned for,
and he arrived at the home simultaneously with the
men who were carrying the prostrate form. The
doctor worked unceasingly for nearly an hour, and
at the end of that time announced that his patient
must have absolute quiet and that no one must attempt
to speak to him for the present.</p>

<p>Horace Coke, who had arrived at the house, was
very much distressed over the accident and showed
especial pain over the doctor’s order.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” he said, “couldn’t I ask him one question?”</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” answered the physician pityingly,
“you can do as you please; but the instant you or
anyone else disobeys my orders I will give this case
up and will not answer for the consequences.”</p>

<p>“Is it that bad?” asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be worse,” replied the doctor; “he
only regained consciousness a few minutes ago. I<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
succeeded in putting him into a light slumber. If
he rests undisturbed for an hour I may save his
life.”</p>

<p>Herbert slipped quietly out of the room while
the two men were speaking.</p>

<p>“He is still sleeping,” he said to the doctor.</p>

<p>The doctor shot a sharp glance at the boy.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t attempt to speak to him,”
rather sternly.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” replied Herbert, flushing up at
this reflection upon his good sense. Slowly, slowly,
the minutes ticked by.</p>

<p>A few of the neighbors remained in the parlor.
The doctor and Mrs. Harkins alone remained in the
sick room. A half hour elapsed. It began to look
as if the life might be saved.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened and a young girl attired
in a dark suit entered the room. Although
youthful, she had the air of restfulness usually found
only in persons of more mature years. She had
great black eyes now full of sympathy with those
in the room. Her dark, glossy hair parted in the
middle, emphasized the extreme whiteness of her
broad forehead. This was Mary Black, daughter
of the banker, and sister of Arthur Black. She
glanced about the apartment until her glance rested
upon Herbert, and going up to him, put her hand
in his with such frankness and tenderness as to<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
bring tears to his eyes. He stepped to one side of
the room. She was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Herbert, I feel for you very, very much,” she
said in a low, melodious voice. “Mother would
not rest until I had come over here to inquire how
your father was getting on. Indeed we all feel for
you and your mother very much. Father was anxious
also.”</p>

<p>She was quick to see that Herbert’s face clouded
up at the mention of her father, and hastened to
add:</p>

<p>“That is what I wished to speak about particularly.
I know that your father and my father
had words; but I can assure you that there is no ill
feeling on father’s part now. I talked with him
long and earnestly, and he finally consented to permit
me to come over here and say this to your
father. The moment he is able to see anyone, I
want to tell him this.”</p>

<p>“You are an angel,” murmured Herbert. “I
don’t thank your father for this visit, but I am
very, very grateful to you.”</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Harkins stepped out of the room,
and Mary made haste to repeat to her what she
had already told Herbert. The face of the older
woman softened at the kind words that were poured
into her ears, and in a moment the girl and the
mother were in each other’s arms, indulging in one<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
of those crys which do so much to relieve the tension
of grief and sorrow.</p>

<p>But Mary Black did not waste much time in useless
tears. She quickly dried her eyes, and turning
to Mrs. Harkins, said with energy:</p>

<p>“Now, I’m going to make myself useful; tell me
what to do first.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Harkins smiled through her tears at this
manifestation of industry. But she felt relieved to
know that feminine hands and feminine eyes would
be in charge of her house while she remained at the
bedside of her stricken husband. Mary Black, during
that hour of anxiety and for many days afterward,
proved herself a genuine angel of mercy.
Those who gazed at her knew that while her nature
was kind and gentle she was yet resolute and determined.</p>

<p>The minutes went by and those who were assembled
in the outer room kept anxious watch on
the door leading to the sick chamber. All instinctively
realized that a crisis was at hand, and
that it was to be decided very shortly. Presently
there was a movement within and the doctor came
out, supporting Mrs. Harkins on his shoulder. A
hush went over the little circle.</p>

<p>“What is it, doctor?” asked Mr. Coke, voicing
the question that hung unspoken on the lips of all
the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>The doctor looked at his questioner in silence for
a moment, and then said impressively:</p>

<p>“He is dead!”</p>

<p>A convulsive sob from the newly made widow
brought Mary Black and some of the neighbors to
her side in an instant. While they were leading
the weeping woman up to her room, the doctor
noted the questioning look in Mr. Coke’s eyes.</p>

<p>“It came very suddenly,” he said; “all was over
in an instant. He died without opening his lips.”</p>

<p>Herbert, who was standing in the rear of the
room unobserved, heard this with blanched face
and parched throat. He realized that the death of
his father marked an epoch in his life. He felt that
he had lost his dearest friend. Yet the tears would
not come to his strained, glassy eyes. He was
amazed that his heart beat on as before. All that
he was conscious of was a strange, unnatural feeling
of numbness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH HERBERT MEETS ADVERSITY AND LEARNS THE MEANING OF HARD WORK</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Harkins home was a very desolate place for
many days after the funeral. Mary Black remained
with the family for several days, moving about
noiselessly and attending to the multitude of details
which would otherwise go neglected at such a sad
period. After the first sharp grief had worn away,
Herbert and his mother sat down and talked over
their prospects for the future. Mr. Harkins had
been prudent enough to leave a small insurance
policy, made out to the order of Mrs. Harkins, and
this money proved to be of immediate assistance to
the widow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harkins was a firm believer in the value
of education, and felt that it was her duty to give
Herbert all the schooling that was possible even if
it was necessary to make a personal sacrifice to
do so. She insisted upon his going to school for at
least a year after the death of his father. He did so
and made gratifying progress; but he was now old
enough to appreciate the responsibility that rested<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
upon him as an only son, so just before the close of
the school term he went to his mother and said:</p>

<p>“See here, mother, I’ve got to help you. There
is no possible way out of it. If I can do so and
continue going to school, all right; if not, I will
never return to the school.”</p>

<p>“What you say is probably true, my boy,” replied
his mother; “but the question is what to do
and how to do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose we settle it now,” said Herbert
resolutely.</p>

<p>“Can’t we postpone the thing for a day or so?”
asked Mrs. Harkins anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Herbert, “we could; but there
is nothing like doing to-day, instead of postponing
until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said his mother, “I think you
had better continue going to school until the close
of the present term, at least.”</p>

<p>“That’s bully!” exclaimed Herbert heartily. “I
am going to put my mind on my studies, and I
don’t think I’ll be a blockhead when the term is
over.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” responded his mother sadly.
“But there is another feature of the case that gives
me great sorrow.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p>“Your college education,” replied his mother.<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
“You know it was your father’s fondest wish, as
well as my own, that after leaving the Cleverly
School you should take the four year course at St.
Joseph’s College. I don’t see how it can be done
now.”</p>

<p>Herbert hung his head and said nothing. The
necessity of abandoning this cherished project was a
severer blow to him than he was willing to admit
to his mother. He had dreamed of a professional
career and often thought that if he were able to go
through the College he would be fitted to take the
necessary examination for either the legal or the
medical profession. But now his dream was over;
he was an only son, and his duty to his mother was
clear. Mr. and Mrs. Harkins were the parents of
three other children; but each of these had died in
early infancy; and now the great heap of earth
which covered the remains of the lamented father
of the house was in close proximity to the three
little mounds which were watered and kept green
by the tender care and love which only a mother
can understand and give. Herbert thought of all
these things as he sat silent that day. Presently
he lifted his head and spoke to his mother.</p>

<p>“Mother, I am old enough to understand my
duty. I wanted to go to the College very, very
much; but now I know that it is impossible. We
must meet adversity, and meet it bravely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>Her only answer was to embrace the boy who was
acquiring manliness at such a rapid rate.</p>

<p>The school question for the term having been
settled, the next question was to consider what steps
could be taken to increase their very small income.
The subject having been opened, was discussed at
various times during the next two weeks. There
was a twenty acre farm adjoining the little home
of the Harkins. It came up against the little vegetable
garden which Mr. Harkins had cultivated
with care and profit during his lifetime. The tenant
of the large tract had been unfortunate, and
he was anxious to sub-let his lease for a very modest
sum of money. Herbert consulted with Mr.
Coke, the lawyer, regarding the matter, and after
some days it was decided to purchase the lease,
which had about two years to run.</p>

<p>The first step in the new life was the engaging
of a farmhand to do the heavy work on the twenty
acre tract. A reliable, industrious man was secured
for a very reasonable amount of wages; but with
the understanding that he would be kept for at
least two years. The work was begun under pleasant
auspices. After it had proceeded a few weeks,
it was decided that Herbert should get as much
schooling as he could in the meantime. It must
be admitted that he attended school rather irregularly
during this period. It was at this time of<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
his life that he learned in a manner never to be forgotten
that this is a world of hard work. Often
he got out of bed before dawn in order to ride
the horse to plough among the growing corn, potatoes
and hops. The program was to get as much
ploughed by ten o’clock in the morning as could be
hoed during the remainder of that day. After this
Herbert would start for school, where he sometimes
arrived as the afternoon session was half through.
In winter his work was lighter, but the snow was
often deep and drifted. The cold was intense, the
north wind piercing and his clothing so thin that he
felt real discomfort.</p>

<p>At night, when his work was over and he had
a spare hour, he made it a habit to study the art
of debating. The first book he ever owned was the
“Columbian Orator,” which was given to him by
his uncle one winter as he lay very sick with the
measles. In the natural order of things Herbert
soon became recognized as the head of the house,
and his mother leaned on him for advice and accepted
his decisions without question. At the end
of the first year, when Herbert balanced his carefully
kept accounts, he found that they had come
out just even. It was a little bit discouraging to
find that they had made no profit from their hard
work; but it was a real consolation to know that
there had been no further drain upon the small<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
amount of money which Mrs. Harkins had laid
aside from her husband’s insurance policy.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second year of farming,
Herbert learned to his amazement that the man
from whom they had purchased the unexpired lease
owed money to a number of tradesmen for implements
and supplies. These men came to him
and demanded the payment of their claims; but he
was neither able nor willing to satisfy them. Herbert
and his man had finished their summer tilling
and their haying when a heavy rain set in near the
end of August. The dreary character of the
weather seemed to fill him with a foreboding of
approaching calamity. One night Mr. Coke came
to him with tidings that their ill fortune was about
to culminate. The following morning the sheriff
and some other officials, with two or three of the
principal creditors, appeared and after formally demanding
payment of their claims, proceeded to
levy on the farm stock, implements, household
effects and other worldly possessions, coupled with
a threat of arrest and imprisonment for the original
tenant who was invisible for some days.</p>

<p>Herbert and his mother stopped with a friendly
neighbor while the work of levying went on. In
the meantime Mr. Coke had not been idle. He denounced
the proceedings as an outrage, saying that
it was wrong both in law and morals to hold Herbert<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
and his mother responsible for the faults or
crimes of another. He did more than protest,
however. He acted and acted promptly. He went
into court, explained the matter very clearly to the
Judge, and succeeded in obtaining an order by which
the levy was stopped. Herbert and his mother immediately
resumed their old life; but at the end
of the year both decided that it would be advisable
to quit farming, which in their circumstances offered
little return for the hard labor involved.</p>

<p>The hired man, who had proven himself to be
an unusually efficient and industrious man, still had
two months of his time to run. He generously
offered to release Herbert from this obligation;
but the boy had inherited his father’s trait of pluck
and manliness, declined to accept the offer. He
had heard that one of the merchants in the town
who had purchased a large amount of ground on
the other side of the railroad, was anxious to have
someone undertake the job of clearing up fifty
acres of the wildest land. Herbert informed his
assistant of that fact, and said that if he was
willing to undertake the work he would guarantee
to give him all that they had contracted to pay in
the beginning. It was in November, and when the
man and boy started to work the snow was just going
and the water and slush in some places were
knee deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>Both were resolute, but they were indifferent
choppers compared with those who usually grapple
with forests, and the job looked so formidable that
farmers and others passing along the turnpike were
accustomed to halt and predict that Herbert would
be a grown man before he saw the end of the job.
But his fighting blood was up and he determined to
plod along without rest until the work was accomplished.
So they continued cutting trees and
bushes, chopping up grown trunks into small
lengths, digging out rotten pines from the soil
where they had imbedded themselves, burning the
brush and worthless sticks, and carting home such
wood as served for fuel. So they persevered until
the job was finally completed. Herbert received
$200 for the work; and after paying the hired man
the $60 that was his due he had $140 left to put
in the family fund. There was still a balance to
their credit. Herbert was very glad the work was
finished. At times he felt that he would give way
under the strain, but pluckily refused to do so.
Frequently at night the sharp lances of the Canadian
thistles had to be dug out of his festered
feet with needles; but he had the stuff in him of
which successful men are made. However, two
years of this sort of toil were sufficient, and at the
end of that time he cheerfully marked “the end”
at the conclusion of his experience at farming.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">HERBERT BECOMES AMBITIOUS AND IS FASCINATED BY THE SMELL OF PRINTERS’ INK</span></h2>
</div>


<p>From the time that he was first able to spell
and connect one word with another, Herbert was
fascinated by the sight of a printed page. If he
saw a circular or a fragment of newspaper on the
sidewalk he was impelled to pick it up and read its
contents. The weekly paper was a rare treat to
him and he perused its columns from the first page
to the last, until he knew the contents almost by
heart. The sight of a book of fiction or adventure
or biography was one of the greatest joys on earth
to him, and he eagerly devoured everything of that
kind that came in his way. Early in his school-days
he had written little essays which after being
read in secret, many times, were finally consigned
to the flames as being unworthy of publicity.</p>

<p>The town, among its other places and things
of interest, possessed a weekly newspaper known
as the Cleverly Banner. Herbert never passed the
office of this newspaper without being filled with
a wild desire to be on the inside instead of the outside<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
of the building. Frequently he stood looking
in the window watching the old-fashioned press as
it slowly ground out the regular weekly edition.
Once or twice he had occasion to call at the office
of the Banner with reference to some printing that
was being done there, and on such occasions he
was thrown into transports of delight. The smell
of the ink, the sound of the presses, and the sight
of the freshly printed pages sent him into an ecstacy
that was almost heavenly in its pleasure.</p>

<p>When he decided to quit farming his eye and
heart unconsciously turned towards the little newspaper
office. One morning he heard that an apprentice
was needed there, he hastened to make
application for the position. The building occupied
by the Banner set back on a little lot facing the
main street of the town. It was a two story and
a half dwelling, and an old faded wooden sign
over the doorway announced the name of the paper
and informed the residents that “Job printing of
all kinds could be furnished on short notice.” The
building itself was half rotted away from age and
want of paint. One editor and one owner after
another had succeeded to the Banner; but it had
never occurred to any of them that it would be a
good stroke of business policy to repair or at least
paint the exterior of the building.</p>

<p>The first floor of the Banner office was taken<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
up with a little counter where such business as was
transacted with the public might be cared for. The
remainder of the room was occupied by a very large
old-fashioned printing press. It worked very
slowly, and as a consequence had to go steadily
two or three days a week in order to turn out the
edition of the paper. The second floor, which resembled
a hay loft more than a place of business,
was utilized as the editorial and composing room.
An old-fashioned stove in the centre of the room
threw out a heat that made the apartment decidedly
uncomfortable at times. A big, sleek cat dozing
placidly beneath this stove was one of the permanent
fixtures of the room.</p>

<p>It was quite early in the morning when Herbert
called at the Banner office, and he did not find anyone
on the first floor. He rapped on the counter
to attract attention, and presently a voice from
upstairs called out in clear, loud tones:</p>

<p>“Come upstairs.”</p>

<p>He climbed up the rude stairway slowly, and
finally emerged into the editorial and composing
room. An elderly man sat in an old-fashioned armchair
in front of a little desk with its top sloping
very much like the desks used in some schools. He
was writing rapidly and pausing every now and
then to dip his pen into a big ink-pot which stood
by his side. Visitors to the Banner office were well<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
acquainted with that enormous ink-stand. It had
been used by the various editors from the time of
the foundation of the Banner and went back so far
that its origin must finally have been lost in the
mists of antiquity. When the industrious writer
had finished a sentence or a paragraph to his satisfaction
he wheeled about in his chair and expectorated
a mouthful of tobacco juice into an ample
cuspidor which stood on the other side of the desk.
He had a shock of snow white hair, very much in
disorder, caused no doubt from his habit of running
his fingers through his hair when in search
of a fugitive thought. He was in his shirt sleeves,
which was his usual habit, for he always protested
that it was not possible for a man to do his
best work harnessed up in a coat and vest. Such
was Noah Brooks, the editor of the Cleverly Banner,
and one of the characters of the town. He
looked up from his work as Herbert entered, and
said:</p>

<p>“Hello there, young man! What can I do for
you?”</p>

<p>“I want you to give me a job,” said Herbert
simply.</p>

<p>This reply seemed to amaze the editor, for he
laid down his pen, pushed back his chair, and placing
his feet on the desk before him, looked at Herbert
with a good-natured smile. It seemed almost<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
a minute before he spoke. When he did it was to
say:</p>

<p>“So you want a job, do you? Well, that’s a
laudable ambition; but I am afraid you have come
to the wrong place.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that,” said Herbert.</p>

<p>Noah Brooks looked at Herbert again before replying,
and then moving slightly and raising the
index finger of his right hand, he pointed to the
rear of the room and said:</p>

<p>“Do you see those fellows over there?”</p>

<p>Herbert looked around and saw a man engaged
in setting type, while a boy with a great big ink
roller in one hand was engaged in taking a proof
of a circular that was about to be printed.</p>

<p>“Yes sir,” he answered obediently; “I see
them.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you know,” said the old gentleman
with a chuckle, “that about all those two fellows
do is to sit around and wait for Saturday night in
order to draw their salaries.”</p>

<p>The humor of this seemed to appeal to the
speaker so strongly that he had to pause and engage
in a hearty laugh before proceeding. The
man and the boy did not appear to be offended.
On the contrary, they laughed too, as if they were
accustomed to the good-natured jests of their employer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” said Herbert, breaking the
silence; “but I was really anxious to get employment
on this paper&mdash;I have long wished to enter
the newspaper business.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Do you know anything about the
business?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Herbert; “I am entirely ignorant
of it; but I felt that I could learn.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk,” was the hearty reply.
“The only way to learn to do a thing is to do it.
I think you would pan out all right in an office
of this kind; but I am sorry to say we have no
opening at the present time.”</p>

<p>Herbert said “Good-by” quietly; but once out
of the building he felt very much depressed at his
failure to secure a situation. He did not tell his
mother of his adventure, not wishing to annoy her
with anything that was not of a cheerful nature.
During the next few months he managed to earn
a small amount of money by odd bits of employment
that were furnished to him through Horace
Coke, the lawyer; but as he had no taste for the
law he did not feel very much encouraged over
this occasional work. His mind still dwelt upon
the newspaper business.</p>

<p>One evening he wrote a little item describing an
entertainment given at the Cleverly High School,
and mailed it to the office of the Banner, without<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
indicating the name or address of the writer. After
he had sent this little message on its way, he
was figuratively speaking, on pins and needles until
the next issue of the Cleverly Banner should
appear. On the date of its regular issue, he hurried
home in order to get the paper as soon as
possible. He was disappointed. It had not arrived.
Unable to wait, he rushed to the post office,
and securing the paper, he eagerly tore off the
wrapping and opened the page which contained
the local news. What he found there caused his
face to flush scarlet. The little item that he had
written with such care was reproduced, word for
word, as he had penned it, without a change of any
kind. He felt so glad that he could have shouted
for joy. Several other persons were in the post
office, and he looked around at them as if to see
whether they had read his secret; but apparently
no one was paying any attention to him. He
walked home in a fever of happiness, and it was
only by the strongest effort on his part that he refrained
from telling his mother about the incident.</p>

<p>Naturally he continued to send little items to
the paper from week to week. Sometimes they
failed to appear. On such occasions he felt a sense
of loss and disappointment that was far out of
proportion to the importance of the subject. But
when the paragraphs did appear that feeling of<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
elation and joy returned to him on each occasion.</p>

<p>Finally he determined to call at the office of the
Banner once more. It was just possible that there
might be an opening, and he made up his mind not
to miss it merely for the sake of asking. The
venerable editor with the snow white hair was in
his place as usual. He recognized Herbert immediately,
and cried out:</p>

<p>“Hello young man! I see you are here again.”</p>

<p>“Yes sir,” replied Herbert. “I do not want to
be a bore, but I felt that it would be all right to
inquire whether an opportunity had arisen by which
I could secure employment on the Banner.”</p>

<p>Once again the old man looked at him in that
quizzical manner.</p>

<p>“Perseverance wins, boy,” he said, “and you
have won. I do need somebody. My apprentice
has left me very suddenly, and I think I can make
use of you. He only got four dollars a week. I
know that will be pretty small for you; but I can
afford to give you six dollars, and if you are willing
to take it the job is yours.”</p>

<p>Herbert could not conceal the pleasure that he
felt.</p>

<p>“I will be delighted to accept,” he said. “When
do you want me to begin, and what may my duties
be?”</p>

<p>“You can begin to-morrow morning at eight<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
o’clock,” was the response; “and your duties at
first will consist of sweeping out the office, serving
the Banner every week, working the printing
press, and making yourself generally useful. That
does not sound very poetic, does it? But you will
find that it will prove a very useful discipline and
may be valuable to you later in life.”</p>

<p>Herbert began his work the following morning
and did everything in his power to give satisfaction
to his employer. If he swept out the office, he did
it so carefully as to win the praise of the journeyman
printer. When he served the papers, he did
it with such accuracy as to merit the approval of
the editor. This continued for several weeks, and
at the end of that time he began to contribute little
local items to the paper, much to the satisfaction
of Mr. Brooks. In the meantime Mr. Anderson
had opened a night school in the town, and
Herbert resolved to attend the sessions of this
school in order to perfect his education as much as
possible.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the winter Mr. Brooks
complimented Herbert by authorizing him to write
the Irvington letter for the Banner. Irvington was
the adjoining town, and by this new arrangement
Herbert had to go there for the items regularly
every week. He walked there and back in mid-winter
in order to obtain this copy, and although<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
the weather was sometimes very severe, he never
complained. Under his arrangement with Mr.
Brooks, he was to remain at the office of the Cleverly
Banner until he was twenty years of age. Incidentally
he was initiated into the mystery of
typesetting, for the Banner, although progressive
in some ways, had not yet reached the dignity of
typesetting machines. The printing press gave
him more trouble than any other part of his work.
On the days that he had to assist in working the
press his hands were blistered and his back lamed
by constant stooping. Yet he was always kindly
treated by those in authority, and in return merited
their confidence and good will.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon on his way home he met
Mary Black, who was as sweet and kind and tender
as ever. Her first thought was about his new
position.</p>

<p>“Herbert, I hear that you are connected with
the Banner.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said modestly, “that is true.”</p>

<p>“Are you the editor?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly.”</p>

<p>“But what do you write for the paper?”</p>

<p>“When I do write,” he said with a little hesitancy,
“it is usually the local paragraphs.”</p>

<p>“Did you write the account of the last entertainment
at the Cleverly High School?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, with an inquiring look in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed impulsively, “I think that
that was just splendid. It was one of the nicest
things I ever read.”</p>

<p>Herbert flushed with conscious pride at this unexpected
praise. He tried to turn it off by saying
that it was only an ordinary piece of work; but
as he walked away he had a difficult time in smothering
the feeling of pride that rose in his breast
in spite of himself. He could scarcely eat his supper
that night so strong was the feeling of elation
within him, and even as late as bedtime the recollection
of the praise given him so sweetly filled him
with as much delight as if he had suddenly fallen
heir to a great fortune.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">HAVING BECOME A NEWSPAPER WRITER, HERBERT LOOKS FOR NEW WORLDS TO CONQUER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the early part of the winter Mr. Brooks was
taken ill with what the doctor diagnosed as grippe.
He thought at first that he would be about in a
few days; but the days lengthened into weeks, and
even then the physician would not permit him to
leave the house. In the beginning of his illness the
editor did a great deal of his work at home, sending
the copy to the office in time for the regular edition
of the Banner. But as time wore on the medical
man frowned upon this, declaring that it was retarding
his recovery.</p>

<p>One day the editor sent for Herbert, and after
some questions regarding himself and the office,
said:</p>

<p>“Herbert, I’m going to place a new responsibility
on you. The doctor has forbidden my doing any
more writing. I want you to take my place. I
want you to write the editorials and as many of
the local items as possible. In short, I want you<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
to manage the Banner until I am able to be about
again. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” replied Herbert.</p>

<p>From that day he felt an added importance, although
he did not show it by act or word. He
must have had a natural instinct for the newspaper
business, for everything moved along with remarkable
smoothness and despite the fact that he had
to labor incessantly he was fond of his work.</p>

<p>Subscribers noticed an improvement in the Banner.
The local paragraphs became more numerous
and were filled with human interest. The
editorials also were crisp and to the point. Indeed
they became a decided feature of the paper whereas
they were formerly accepted as a painful necessity.
One day an old reader of the paper who came in
to renew his subscription to the paper, said:</p>

<p>“I want to congratulate you on the good paper
you are getting out. This is especially true of the
editorial columns. I find the comment on the news
to be short and snappy. This is much better than
the long articles which used to be more or less instructive,
but generally as dull as sermons. How
do you do it? You must have some secret method.
What is it?”</p>

<p>Herbert smiled at this sweeping praise. He
pointed to a little motto which hung over his
desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said, “unless it is because
I follow the advice on that card.”</p>

<p>The little inscription to which he pointed said
simply:</p>

<p>“Brevity is the soul of wit.”</p>

<p>“That is as true to-day,” he remarked, “as when
it was first penned by the great poet.”</p>

<p>Herbert did not tell his caller one of the means
he had used to arrive at such a desirable end.
When he began writing editorials he found himself
almost unconsciously padding them out to a
half column and a column in length. He pondered
long and earnestly over the means of breaking
himself of the habit. Finally he hit on a plan which
was as simple as it was effective. He cut his copy
paper in such a length that it would not hold more
than eight or ten lines. When he got an idea for
an editorial comment, he endeavored to express it
clearly and pointedly in the number of words that
would go on the small sheet of paper. At first it
was a very difficult task, but practice makes perfect,
and at length he found that he could do it with
comparative ease and eventually reached the state
of things which had won him unstinted praise.</p>

<p>He had not been in charge of the Banner long
before he realized that the local news was the most
important thing in the paper to the people of Cleverly.
Accordingly he bent all of his energies to<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
the improvement of that department. He pressed
the postmaster into his service. He induced some
of the young men of the town to contribute, and
as a result there was not a wedding, a birth or a
funeral that was not fully reported in the Banner.
He laid great stress on personal items, taking the
ground that a pleasant reference to anyone not
only interested the person mentioned, but also their
relatives and friends as well as the people of the
town. If a church raised its mortgage, or a citizen
put an addition to his house, or the school gave
an entertainment it was sure to be found in the
local columns. It was not surprising, therefore,
that the subscribers looked forward with eagerness
for their paper and complained bitterly if, by
chance, they failed to receive it.</p>

<p>Herbert avoided rumors and scandals with
scrupulous care. He made up his mind that as
long as he was at the helm such things would not
find their way into the weekly. He remembered,
with bitterness, the stories that had been circulated
about his father, and while they had been well nigh
forgotten by the people of the town, they were still
treasured up in a corner of his memory. He frequently
talked with his mother, and although she
gave him no encouragement, persisted in a determination
to clear his father’s name.</p>

<p>“There was some strange mystery connected<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
with father’s last day,” he said, “and I will never
rest entirely happy until it has been fully cleared.
I believe the suggestion that he stole that money
was a base calumny, but I will not be content until
the world is convinced that he was innocent.”</p>

<p>His face would darken at this, and he would add:</p>

<p>“And when his innocence is proved the guilt
of someone else will be established, and that person,
whoever it may be, need expect no mercy from me.”</p>

<p>One day when he had been talking in this strain
his mother said:</p>

<p>“Herbert, I want you to drop this sort of thing.
You are on the verge of man’s estate and you
should look forward and not backward. I feel the
blot on your father’s good name quite as keenly as
you do, but I would be most unhappy if I thought
you would permit it to embitter your life. This
is a busy world, and the people in it&mdash;men and
women&mdash;have little time for the person who is
nursing a grievance.”</p>

<p>“You mean well, mother,” replied the young
journalist, “but you do not realize the feeling I
have. It is not a feeling of bitterness; it is not a
grievance; it is a desire&mdash;a desire that will not be
quenched&mdash;for justice. No matter where I go or
what I may do, this desire remains with me, and
some day it shall be gratified.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>She stroked his hands fondly and looked at him
with undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>“While you live your father will never die&mdash;you
resemble him in more ways than one. Go
ahead and carry out your own designs. I am content
to have you do as you will.”</p>

<p>In the meantime the circulation of the Banner
was increasing by leaps and bounds. The job printing
office was going at full speed. This condition
of affairs began to show itself in the accounts.
Noah Brooks, who was beginning to improve in
health, noticed it with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Herbert,” he said when the young man visited
him one day, “I am satisfied that you have made
good. I have resolved to make your salary ten dollars
a week. Probably you are worth more than
that, but it is all I can do at present.”</p>

<p>“It will be gratefully accepted,” replied Herbert.
“It is a proof that you are satisfied with my work,
and that is compensation in itself.”</p>

<p>During this time the young man, who was soon
to celebrate his twenty-first birthday, had not neglected
to advance himself in the art of writing.
He felt that this was to be his trade, and that if a
man devoted years to the work of becoming a proficient
carpenter or bricklayer there was no reason
why he should not also give time and study to the
work of learning to write. He had left school, but<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
Mr. Anderson, who had been his devoted friend
from the time he had routed the other boys from
the schoolhouse on “barring out day,” very kindly
offered to give him a special course of instruction in
English composition. By this means the long
winter passed away very quickly, and Herbert advanced
rapidly in his chosen business.</p>

<p>One evening when Herbert came home from his
studies, a little earlier than usual, he found Mary
Black in the parlor with his mother. After the
usual cordial greetings she said timidly:</p>

<p>“I hope you have forgiven us for the dreadful
things that occurred before your father’s death.”</p>

<p>“We have nothing to forgive you for, Mary,”
said Herbert gently. “If there has been any obligation
it is entirely on our side. I am sure that neither
mother nor I can ever forget your kindness.”</p>

<p>She flushed a little at this, and then after some
hesitancy, said:</p>

<p>“It’s not that. I know you have only kind feelings
toward me. But I want you to be charitable
to father and&mdash;and to Arthur.”</p>

<p>She hung her head, and Herbert, a trifle embarrassed,
made no reply. He glanced up and noticed
that her eyes were red and her face careworn. His
mother noticed the look, and quickly stepped in the
breach.</p>

<p>“Mary is in trouble,” she said; “Arthur left<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
home last week and has not been heard of since
then.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Herbert impulsively, going up and
taking her hands. “I am very, very sorry to hear
this, and if I can assist you in any way you need only
command me.”</p>

<p>Her only reply was to weep quietly. Mrs. Harkins
took her in her arms and soothed her with
motherly kindness. Herbert felt quite awkward at
this scene. First he stood on one foot and then on
the other. Finally for want of something to say
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You can rest assured that I have no feelings of
resentment toward your father or Arthur. I was
angry with them, very angry; but I am not vindictive.”</p>

<p>He did not add that the fact that she was the
daughter of one and the sister of the other caused
him to utter such a generous sentiment.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea where Arthur has gone?”
he asked a moment later.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied; “that is what makes it so
distressing. If it were not for the uncertainty we
might feel resigned.”</p>

<p>“Did anyone go with him?”</p>

<p>“We are not sure, but he was seen with Harry
Adler just before he left.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Herbert. “Then it’s ten to<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
one he has gone to New York. Adler has a perfect
mania for that place.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” ejaculated Mrs. Harkins, “because
if that’s so, Arthur is in very bad company in a
very wicked place.”</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Herbert had to laugh at the
vehemence with which his mother uttered her sentiments.
After some further conversation he said:</p>

<p>“I may be able to help you, Mary. You know
Mr. Anderson has gone to New York to accept a
position as teacher in a private academy. I’ll write
to him and ask him to keep on the lookout for Arthur.
Of course New York is a big city and it
seems like looking for a needle in a haystack, but it’s
just possible he may run across him. Anyhow it
will do no harm to try.”</p>

<p>The letter was dispatched that night. As he
posted it Herbert little thought it was to be the
messenger which was to summon him to newer,
higher and more responsible duties. But a kind
fate which conceals from us the misfortunes we are
to undergo also hides from us the path which is to
lead to happiness and prosperity. Although Noah
Brooks had returned to the office and was able to
resume his work, he insisted that Herbert should
continue the writing he had been doing so well.</p>

<p>Three days later Herbert received a letter postmarked
New York. He rightly surmised that it<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
was from Mr. Anderson. It was brief and cordial.
It said that he had heard nothing of Arthur Black,
but that if he should run across him in the future
he would immediately notify the family at Cleverly.
There was a postscript to the letter, and unusual for
a man’s postscript, it contained the most important
thing of all. Mr. Anderson said that he had become
acquainted with the city editor of the Argus,
one of the important daily newspapers of the metropolis,
and that he had the disposal of a position on
the local staff which would pay fifteen dollars a
week at the start, with a prospect for promotion and
increased salary at an early date. The teacher said
that Herbert’s letter had reached him opportunely
and that he had strongly recommended his young
friend for the position. The city editor, he added,
would give him one week in which to either accept
or decline the offer.</p>

<p>Herbert jumped at least two feet in the air when
he had finished reading this letter. It offered him
an opportunity he had secretly coveted for a long
while. He hurried home to show the communication
to his mother. Dinner had been served and
she was waiting for him. As he took his place at
the table, he tossed the envelope over to her.</p>

<p>“A letter from New York,” he said.</p>

<p>She read it through carefully. When she reached
the postscript a shadow crossed her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it?” she asked.</p>

<p>He appreciated fully the meaning of that question.
He understood that the answer to it meant
either the continuance of their present comfortable
home life or a temporary painful separation. But
he knew his mother well too, and he realized from
her tone and manner that she did not intend to advise
him one way or the other. She was interested
in his welfare and would let him settle the question
for himself. Nevertheless she waited, with some
anxiety, for the reply. Herbert walked over and
put his arms about her shoulders as if to reassure
her, and then replied in a low tone:</p>

<p>“I will make my decision within twenty-four
hours.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">WHICH TELLS OF HOW HERBERT CAME TO LEAVE THE TOWN OF CLEVERLY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As soon as he arrived at the office of the Banner
on the following morning, Herbert showed Noah
Brooks the letter he had received from New York,
and said he had not yet decided whether to accept
or decline the proffer of the position on the New
York Argus.</p>

<p>“It is not a matter of salary, Mr. Brooks,” he
said, “but the question of my future. The prospect
of an opening in the metropolis is alluring, yet I
dislike the idea of leaving Cleverly.”</p>

<p>“Take your time and do the right thing, Herbert,”
said the veteran editor. “As you are aware,
your time with me expired some months ago, and
your further continuance depends entirely upon
yourself. I am frank enough to say that there is
not much chance of advancement here.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the young man left the
office for the purpose of transacting some business
with the postmaster of the town. That official had
stepped out for the moment, but his clerk courteously<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
invited Herbert to take a seat in his private
office and await his return. For a few minutes the
young man whiled away the time by idly turning
over the pages of some newspapers that he found
upon the postmaster’s desk. Presently his attention
was attracted by the sound of footsteps in the outside
corridor. It was nearly mail time, and people
were assembling for the purpose of receiving their
letters and papers. The board partition between the
private office and the outside room was very thin,
and Herbert could hear bits of conversation. He
paid no attention to them at first, but after a while
the mention of his father’s name caused him to
prick up his ears in wonder. He recognized the
voices of the two speakers; one was a well-to-do
farmer named Bingham who operated an extensive
place just outside of Cleverly; the other, John Peterson,
a wholesale grocer, ranked among the leading
citizens of the town. They were in a secluded corner
of the post office, and after a while their conversation
became quite animated. Bingham was
doing most of the talking. He said very earnestly:</p>

<p>“I always liked Dave Harkins, and it has been
a standing regret with me that the mystery of his
last days was never cleared up.”</p>

<p>“I have heard a great deal about that,” responded
Peterson, “but I have never been able to get head<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
or tail of the affair. There was a mystery sure
enough, and Harkins died under a cloud; but it was
never explained to me by anyone who was in a position
to talk about the matter.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the other slowly, “I can’t say
that I am an authority on the subject; yet I know
some of the facts. It seems that old man Black
took an unaccountable dislike to Dave Harkins and
went to him and insisted upon the immediate repayment
of a loan that he had made some time previous.
Harkins was not supposed to have an extra dollar
in the world. Yet he paid the loan in full the following
day. That night&mdash;or rather the night before&mdash;Black’s
place was broken into and a bundle
of money stolen. Now the curious part of the story
is the allegation that the money which Harkins used
to pay off his debt to Black, was the identical cash
that was taken from Black’s desk the night before.
That is the shape the rumors took. For my part I
don’t believe it; and yet, unfortunately, Dave Harkins
died before he could set himself straight with
the community. His wife and son have never attempted
to clear the matter up. Probably they are
unable to do so. You don’t suppose that Dave Harkins
could have been tempted to take the money, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Lord forbid,” rejoined the other, “I believe
that he was a thoroughly honest man; but the thing<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
is to get other people to believe the same thing. A
bit of scandal is a terrible thing; it may start out in
the beginning no bigger than the tip end of a pin;
but by the time it gets through growing it is taller
than one of those skyscraping office buildings in
New York. To tell you the truth I dislike to talk
about such things. You are the first man I ever
discussed the Harkins case with. Whenever the
subject is brought up&mdash;and it has been mentioned
to me once or twice&mdash;I always pooh-hooh it.”</p>

<p>“What reminds you of it to-day?” inquired his
companion.</p>

<p>“Young Harkins,” was the prompt rejoinder.
“I stopped in at the Banner office to congratulate
old man Brooks on the way that young man was
running the paper for him, and he astonished me
by the news that young Harkins was likely to leave
him. He’s got an offer to go to New York and
he’s considering it just now. Do you think it is
possible, Bingham, that this story concerning his
father affects his standing in the community?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” was the quick response. “A
thing of that kind will never die a natural death in
a little town like this. It has either got to be cleared
up and ripped out of existence, root and branch, or
it will go on thriving until Gabriel’s trumpet summons
the people to another world.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other speaker, “I am glad to<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
know you believed in Dave Harkins, because I
rather liked the man myself.”</p>

<p>“I believed in him as I believe in my life.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the son?” asked Bingham,
after a short pause.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Peterson in his nasal voice; “I kind
o’ think he’s a chip off the old block. I think if he
gets a chance he will make good.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” assented Bingham in a hearty voice.</p>

<p>Herbert, seated behind the partition, could stand
the strain no longer. He jumped from his chair
and opening the door suddenly, presented himself
to the two men. Their astonishment made them
speechless. Herbert going over to them, put out his
two hands and grasping their hardened palms, he
said:</p>

<p>“I have been an unintentional listener to your
conversation. I have heard all that you have said
about my father and myself, and I want to tell you
that I am grateful for the belief you have expressed
in his honesty and mine.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” mumbled Peterson. “I
never dreamt you were near by, or I’d been more
cautious in my conversation.”</p>

<p>“I am glad I heard it,” replied Herbert, with
glistening eyes. “It has uncovered the truth for
me. I have had an offer from New York. I hesitated
about leaving Cleverly. I like the Banner,<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
and I like the place; but I find now that my duty
is elsewhere. The man who gave that money to
my father left here and went straight to New York.
He has been swallowed up amid millions of other
men; but I’ll find him somewhere and in some way
if it takes the rest of my life. I thank you, gentlemen,
for the things you have said. Before I heard
them I was in doubt; now everything is clear to
me. My decision is made; I am off to New York.”</p>

<p>With flushed face and eager step the young man
hurried from the post office and walked rapidly
down the main street. Mr. Brooks was preparing
to go to his lunch when Herbert hurried into the
Banner office.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you in about an hour, Herbert,” he said
smilingly.</p>

<p>“If you will wait a moment I would like to speak
to you now,” replied Herbert quickly.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the other, with an anxious
look in his face. “If it’s about New York I’d like
to tell you that you can take your own time in coming
to a decision. Take a week if you need it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need a minute,” replied Herbert impetuously,
“I am grateful to you for your kindness;
but my decision is already made. I am going to
New York, and I am going at the earliest possible
moment.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brooks expressed the regret that he felt and<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
then left the young man. Herbert’s next task was
to inform his mother of his decision. He knew
that the change would be a violent one for her, but
felt in his heart that he was only doing his duty to
her as well as to the memory of his dead father.
He walked slowly to his home, and when he entered,
found his mother seated in an armchair by
the window engaged in some knitting. He walked
into the room on tiptoe, and going back of her,
threw his arms about her neck.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said softly.</p>

<p>“Well, Herbert,” she replied, in a gentle voice.
“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I am going to tell you something that may not
be pleasant for you to hear, and I want you to
promise me that you will bear with it for my sake.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, with a look of pain on
her face.</p>

<p>“Will you promise?” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, very slowly, but with emphasis.
“I’ll promise to be reconciled to anything that is
for your good.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said after a short pause, “I have
come to a decision. I am going to New York, and
I am going within forty-eight hours.”</p>

<p>The tears came to her eyes, but she bravely repressed
them, and arising, took Herbert in her arms
and gave him a motherly kiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>“Bless you, my son,” she said, “and go ahead
and do what you believe is for the best.”</p>

<p>From that time until the moment of his departure
Herbert was kept busy in completing his arrangements
for moving to the metropolis. His
chief business was in completing his work for the
current issue of the Banner. When the other persons
who were connected with the paper heard of
his prospective departure they were very much disappointed
because Herbert was a general favorite
in the office. The young man himself was so agitated
at the thought of leaving those with whom he
had been in contact so long and so pleasantly that
he could scarcely get through with his routine work.</p>

<p>The morning for his departure dawned at last,
and he started for the train with a gripsack in one
hand and an umbrella in the other. His mother accompanied
him, and on the way gave him a great
deal of homely advice regarding his future life in
the big city. It was understood that he should go
on with his work and if it should prove successful
that later on he would send for his mother and
thereafter both of them would make their home in
New York. In the meantime he promised to send
her part of his earnings every week, and in spite of
her protests, made the amount the major part of
his salary. On the way to the train they passed the
home of John Black. Mary Black was just coming<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
out of the doorway, and when she saw the mother
and son, joined them on the way to the station.</p>

<p>“I wish you God-speed, Herbert,” she said, with
undoubted sincerity; “and if you see anything of
Arthur it will be a real charity for you to inform us
of the fact. Mother and father are very much distressed
over his absence.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard anything from him since he
left?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, holding her head down.
“He has written to me twice, each time to ask me
for money.”</p>

<p>“And you gave it to him?” inquired Herbert.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied. “Perhaps it was wrong;
but I could not refuse it. He did not give any address,
but had the mail sent to the General Delivery
window of the main post office building.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mary,” said Herbert, “I assure you that
if I am ever in a position to assist you either in
Arthur’s case, or in any other manner, I will be only
too glad to do so.”</p>

<p>They had reached the station by this time, and in
a moment or two were joined by Noah Brooks,
who insisted on coming along to say good-by to his
much valued assistant and associate editor.</p>

<p>Brooks was silent for some time, but his face
showed the feeling that he was endeavoring to repress.
Going over to Herbert, he put his arm<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
around his shoulder in an affectionate manner, and
said:</p>

<p>“My boy, I have to thank you for the fidelity you
have always shown to my interests. I don’t know
what in the world I’ll do without you; indeed I
don’t.”</p>

<p>Just then the train pulled in at the station and
Herbert, after a last good-by, jumped aboard. The
engine pulled out quickly, and the young man standing
on the rear platform, shook his handkerchief
in farewell to his mother and friends. As the train
gradually put distance between itself and Cleverly,
Herbert was filled with a strange emotion which he
could not understand. He was leaving the home of
his birth and his youth, and his heart was strangely
touched at the thought. The train puffed on, and
soon the little group on the station became mere
specks in the distance; but the last thing that Herbert
saw was the trim figure and the two bright
eyes, half dimmed with tears, belonging to Mary
Black.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">HERBERT IS AWED AND AMAZED BY HIS FIRST SIGHT OF A GREAT CITY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The train made good time, and in two hours arrived
in Jersey City. From the shed to the two
story ferry-boat which plied between the two shores
was but a step. When the boat pulled out into the
stream, Herbert was dazzled by the sight that met
his eyes. Through force of circumstances over
which he had no control, he had never visited New
York, and so it came about that this was to be his
first view of the wonderful city of the Western
Continent. His gaze rested first on the magnificent
Statue of Liberty enlightening the world&mdash;that
colossal bit of statuary placed in New York harbor
not only to typify the grandeur of American institutions,
but also to emphasize the long friendship
existing between America and France. Beyond
this he beheld that great piece of engineering known
as the Brooklyn Bridge, the girdle, the connecting
link which is the visible bond uniting the two great
cities of Greater New York.</p>

<p>In the harbor boats were coming and going in<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
every direction, carrying people and merchandise
from the four corners of the earth. A monster
ocean steamer plowing its way majestically through
the waves, its deck literally black with people eager
for the first glimpse of land, was making towards
the new Castle Garden, there to empty upon the
shores of America more men and women than there
were in the entire population of Cleverly. Another
magnificent ocean greyhound just going down the
bay was filled with rich Americans, millionaires and
men made suddenly rich who were embarking for
foreign shores to spend the money they had dug
from the bowels of the earth, or cleverly obtained
by ingenuity or trade from their fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>Herbert felt as he gazed out on this constantly
moving panorama, as if the whole world had suddenly
burst on his view. From the time he left the
Jersey City shore until he reached the New York
side, his mind was in a whirl trying to grasp and
comprehend all the strange sights that were constantly
coming within his view. No time was lost
in landing, and in a minute or two the country-reared
boy found himself in the midst of what
seemed to be a hopeless confusion of trucks and
drays and cursing drivers. A policeman with uplifted
club soon straightened out this tangle, and
Herbert proceeded on his way up Cortlandt Street.
The rush and roar of the elevated trains, the shouts<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
and protests of the wagon drivers, the yells of the
cabmen and peddlers, and the never ceasing hum
of talk from the hurrying pedestrians, made Herbert
feel as if this were all some wonderful dream.</p>

<p>He spoke to a policeman, asking him the way to
Broadway.</p>

<p>“Follow your nose, Johnny, for two blocks,” was
the flippant rejoinder.</p>

<p>Herbert flushed up a little at this. He was not
accustomed to being addressed in such a manner.
In fact before he left Cleverly he was looked upon
as one of the important persons of the town; but
in New York, like many other persons of greater
importance, Herbert was soon stripped of his dignity
and self-esteem. He continued on his way up the
hilly street until he finally found himself on a corner
of that throbbing, pulsating, crowded and ever
changing thoroughfare which is known by reputation
all over the civilized world as Broadway. He
walked along its diagonal length for some distance
looking in the shop windows, gazing at the crowds,
and greedily drinking in the sights that presented
themselves on all sides. The noise and the hum
and the din were continuous. It began to give him
a headache. He wondered how the people were able
to stand such a tumultuous existence. Still more,
he wondered how soon he would become accustomed
to this new condition of things, little thinking that<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
most of that confused multitude had come to New
York like himself, a stranger in a strange city, and
many of them strangers in a strange land.</p>

<p>After he had partially satisfied his curiosity he
determined to look for lodgings. He had the address
of Mr. Anderson on a little card. He knew
from a letter he had received that it was somewhere
on upper Sixth Avenue, and after making one or
two mistakes in the direction he took, he finally succeeded
in boarding a Sixth Avenue elevated train
and was whizzed along towards the up-town section
of New York City. It was quite a sensation
to ride so far up in the air and to be able to look
into the open bedroom windows of the people who
lived on either side of the elevated road. He
thought he must have surely struck New York on
wash-day, because every window and every areaway
appeared to be filled with shirts and other articles
of wearing apparel. Finally he reached the street
that was nearest his destination, and getting out of
the train, walked down the high steps towards that
section of Sixth Avenue which had been described
to him by his former teacher.</p>

<p>On the way, for the first time it dawned upon
him that his appearance must be a little bit odd to
the pedestrians who passed him on the street. He
was twenty-one years old, tall, slender, pale and
plain, with twenty-five dollars in his pocket&mdash;he<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
had persisted in giving his mother the remainder of
his money, claiming that with a position assured he
had no need of a large surplus. Nearly all of the
clothing he possessed was on his back, and in addition
to that his total capital was a knowledge of
so much of the art of printing and so much of the
art of reporting and editing as a youth is enabled
to learn in the office of an enterprising country
newspaper. But the most acute feeling that came
over him at this time was a sense of terrible loneliness.
With the possible exception of Mr. Anderson,
he knew no human being within two hundred
miles, and his rustic manner and address, he felt
satisfied, did not favor the immediate making of
new friendships. His personal estate, which was
neatly tied up in a little packet, did not encumber
him, and he stepped along lightly in his search for
Mr. Anderson’s boarding house. The landlady
proved to be a very pleasant woman, and when he
inquired for his friend, told him that he had been unexpectedly
called out of the city and would be gone
for a week. When he inquired about accommodations
she showed him a nice, pleasant room which
he could have with board for the sum of $8 a week.
Herbert immediately rejected this proffer as being
a little more expensive than he was able to undertake.</p>

<p>Somewhat disappointed, he boarded the elevated<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
train once more and was soon whirled down-town.
He wandered about aimlessly for some time, wondering
where he should look for a boarding house.
Passing one of the newspaper offices, he purchased
an evening edition and looked in the columns marked
“Boarding” and “Rooms to Rent.” There were
hundreds of advertisements, but they gave no clue
to the character of the houses, and very few of
them announced their terms. He threw the paper
away as useless and continued walking towards the
North River. Finally he came to a rather respectable
looking house with a brick front, containing
the sign “Boarding.” He entered, introduced himself
to the landlady, and was offered shelter and
subsistence at $5 a week. The room that was offered
for his inspection was comfortable, and the
price seemed reasonable, so he closed the bargain at
once.</p>

<p>After depositing his little package in his room
and washing himself and ridding his clothing of
the stains of travel, he left the house to make some
purchases of little articles that were necessary for
his attire. Once again he walked about in a rather
aimless manner, and in the course of his travels
finally reached the thoroughfare known as the Bowery.
It proved to be quite a different place from
the street that he had pictured in his mind. There
were some few dance halls and concert rooms, it is<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
true, but in addition to that he was surprised to see
the unusually large number of bright looking retail
stores and business houses. He was gazing in
the window of one of these stores when someone
tapped him on the arm and said in a whining voice:</p>

<p>“Say, boss, can’t you help a poor fellow out?”</p>

<p>He turned quickly, and to his great astonishment,
beheld Harry Adler standing before him. He had
not seen the man since he left Cleverly in company
with Arthur Black. The appearance of Adler indicated
that he had been a victim either of great
misfortune, or of the persistent laziness which
seemed to be part of his character. He was very
thinly clad; in fact his coat seemed to be a mass of
rags, and there were holes in the rough shoes that
he wore on his feet. A hat with a torn brim
covered his bushy hair, and he was entirely innocent
of collar or necktie. A heavy beard suggested continuous
neglect of the barber.</p>

<p>“Harry Adler!” exclaimed Herbert. “You are
the last man in the world I expected to meet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess that’s so,” said Adler, beginning
to sniffle; “but you see, Herbert, I’ve been playing
in very hard luck. I came to the city to get work,
and after I had been at it for about a week I was
taken sick and sent to the hospital. When I came
out of that institution I was so weak that I was not
able to hunt for employment, and I finally got in<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
such a condition that I had to beg for a bit to eat.”</p>

<p>Herbert looked at the fellow in a skeptical manner.
Then he gave a significant sniff of his nose.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve been drinking,” he cried.
“Probably that has prevented you from being a
successful business man in New York.”</p>

<p>Adler pretended not to notice this bit of irony
and continued:</p>

<p>“Herbert, you’ve got a chance to make a man out
of me. I know we haven’t been very good friends;
but if you will help to straighten me out you will
never have cause to regret it.”</p>

<p>“Where is Arthur Black?” asked Herbert, disregarding
the other’s appeal.</p>

<p>“He’s up at my boarding house,” replied Adler,
with a whimper.</p>

<p>“Well, I would like to see him very much,” responded
Herbert. “Will you promise to make an
arrangement so that I can meet him somewhere to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I will,” replied the other, “if you
will help me out a little bit I will do anything for
you.”</p>

<p>“Well I don’t want you to do anything, except
to have Arthur Black meet me.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll do that.”</p>

<p>“Where is your boarding house?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>Adler looked a little bit scared at this question,
and then said in a husky tone:</p>

<p>“Oh, it wouldn’t do for you to come to our
boarding house. It’s too humble for the likes of
you; but I tell you what I’ll do. I’ll arrange to
have Arthur Black meet you in the corridor of the
main post office building at eight o’clock to-night.
I’ll do that sure if you help me out.”</p>

<p>The constant appeal for personal help finally impressed
itself upon Herbert, and he said:</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other in a quavering voice, “I
guess a coat and a shave and a pair of shoes wouldn’t
be bad to start with.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll try to fit you out with them,” said
Herbert, “if you don’t let it cost too much.”</p>

<p>So the queerly assorted pair entered a clothing
house on the Bowery, where Adler succeeded in obtaining
a coat and a pair of shoes for ten dollars.
Following that he was taken into a barber shop and
treated to a clean shave and haircut. The improvement
in his appearance was remarkable.</p>

<p>“How do you feel now?” asked Herbert, looking
at him approvingly.</p>

<p>“Pretty good, but mighty hungry.”</p>

<p>“Well, come with me, and I’ll get you something
to eat.”</p>

<p>The two men repaired to a near-by restaurant and<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
Adler was treated to what was probably the best
meal he had enjoyed in many a long day.</p>

<p>Herbert settled the score, and once more telling
him to be sure to have Arthur Black at the post
office at eight o’clock, parted with him and went
around to his own lodgings. He looked over his
money and found that after paying his board and
spending money for food and clothing on Adler and
giving the lazy one a two dollar bill, he had only
four dollars left to his credit. He was somewhat
annoyed at this; but consoled himself with the
thought that he would begin employment the next
day and would soon have sufficient ready money to
satisfy all of his needs. At times he felt angry with
himself for having helped Adler, who after all that
was said and done, was a very worthless sort of
fellow. But on reflection he felt that he might have
done the man some good, and that thought was sufficient
to give him a feeling of pleasant self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>He left the house immediately after dinner, and
after a short walk on Broadway, found himself in
the corridor of the main post office at a quarter before
eight. He stationed himself in such a position
as to command a view of all of those who entered or
left the building. It was irksome business waiting
for anyone in that place. The hands of the clock
gradually moved around and it finally struck eight,<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
but there was no sign of Arthur Black. Herbert
waited on, feeling that the expected visitor would be
likely to come in at any minute; but time continued
to pass, and finally the clock struck nine. Herbert
turned and left the building, filled with great disgust:</p>

<p>“Buncoed!” he muttered to himself. “Buncoed,
by gosh! My first day in New York and I
permit myself to be buncoed by a man who was
even without standing in Cleverly! That’s a pretty
good lesson for my first day in the metropolis.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH HERBERT BECOMES ACQUAINTED WITH SOME OF THE METHODS OF MODERN JOURNALISM</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert had been advised to call at the Argus
office at noon for the purpose of presenting his letter
of introduction to Mr. Blakeley, the city editor of
that newspaper. He prepared himself carefully for
the forthcoming interview, trying especially in a
half conscious way to rid himself of the rustic appearance
which he felt might lessen his prospects,
or impair his prestige with the newspaper man he
was about to meet. The Argus office was located
almost in the center of the cluster of large buildings
on Park Row, and as Herbert looked up at the
edifice he could not repress a feeling of pride at the
thought that in a day or so he would be numbered
among the busy workers in that bee-hive of industry.</p>

<p>He took the elevator and was shot up to the fifth
floor with a suddenness that almost took his breath
away. A boy standing at the door of this landing
demanded his card, and while Herbert sat there
waiting for a reply he noticed that the door was<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
kept locked, and that newcomers were greeted with
a large sign which read:</p>

<p>“Positively no admittance except on business.”</p>

<p>He thought this was rather inhospitable at the
time, but later in his career realized that it was a
necessity in order to permit the orderly and speedy
transaction of business. A newspaper office is
looked upon as the Mecca for eccentric people of
all kinds and characters and if they were admitted
promiscuously they would consume the time of the
editors and reporters and make it impossible to issue
the paper at all.</p>

<p>Presently the office boy returned, and said:</p>

<p>“Step inside.”</p>

<p>He walked into a large room and was directed to
a smaller room, which was partitioned off in the
extreme corner. A tall, thin man rose to greet him,
and nodding in a friendly way, pointed to a chair:</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said this gentleman, “that Mr.
Blakeley, the city editor of the Argus, is not here
to-day. This is his day off. However he spoke to
me about you and I am very glad to meet you; but
it is not possible for me to serve you in any way
to-day. It will be necessary for you to see him in
person before you can go to work.”</p>

<p>Herbert thanked him for his courtesy and the
pleasant manner in which he had been greeted and
promised to return again the next day. In the few<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
minutes he was in the office he noticed that the room
was gradually beginning to assume an air of activity.
Men were coming in constantly and seating
themselves in front of desks in the large apartment,
which because of the ink and paper and pencils and
furniture looked very much like a large edition of
the old schoolroom in Cleverly.</p>

<p>Herbert was quite disappointed at not seeing Mr.
Blakeley on his first visit, but resolved to utilize the
remainder of the day by sight-seeing. He visited
many of the places of interest in New York, including
the Aquarium, the tomb of General Grant at
Riverside Park, and the Metropolitan Museum in
Central Park. All of these things were deeply interesting,
and in a larger sense highly educational.
On his way home he purchased copies of all the
afternoon papers, and after dinner that evening
spent several hours in going over them very carefully
with a view of becoming familiar with the
style of reporting that prevailed on the popular
newspapers in New York City. In spite of the
fact that he had put in a very busy day he went to
bed with a feeling of regret over the apparent loss
of two whole days.</p>

<p>At noon the following day he was again at the
Argus office, and this time was successful in meeting
Mr. Blakeley. The city editor was a short,
stockily built man, wearing eyeglasses and possessed<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
of a quick, nervous manner. He looked Herbert
over from head to foot as soon as he entered and
gazed at him very earnestly during all the course of
their brief conversation.</p>

<p>“Harkins,” he said, after the usual greeting, “I
am going to put you on the Argus at a salary.
This is somewhat unusual, because nearly all on our
staff are space men. New men especially are put
on space, which simply means that they are paid
for what they write, in order to test their ability.
But Mr. Anderson, who is an old friend of mine,
has recommended you so highly that I am going to
put you on the regular staff at once; and I will give
you three weeks in which to demonstrate your ability
to hold the place down permanently.”</p>

<p>“I thank you very much,” said Herbert, “I will
try to prove myself worthy of the confidence you
are placing in me.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the other skeptically, “I
don’t want any promises; all I want is the performance.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” said Herbert; “I’ll not make any
promises; but I can assure you that I will try to
size up to the position.”</p>

<p>“That sounds business,” retorted the other in his
quick, jerky style. Then looking up at the calendar,
he said musingly: “It’s a little too late in the
week for you to do anything now. You can report<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
for duty at noon next Monday. Meantime I would
advise you to become acquainted with the city and
its institutions, and to book yourself up as speedily
as possible on the men and things who go to make
up life in this busy town.”</p>

<p>Herbert promised to do as he was advised, and
then met the tall, spare man with whom he had held
the conversation the day before. This was the assistant
city editor, who took him in hand and introduced
him to such other members of the Argus
staff as were in the office at that time. They were
all pleasant and affable, but Herbert took an immediate
and special liking to Francis Tomlin, one
of the reporters, who had greeted him in a very
kindly spirit.</p>

<p>“Don’t permit the noise and bustle and confusion
of this place to confuse you,” said Tomlin, “because
it will not take you many days to know that that
is merely the outer covering, or what we might call
the atmosphere of the place. You will find that the
work itself moves along in a precise and systematic
manner. Come in to-night around the midnight
hour and see the office going at full blast.”</p>

<p>Herbert accepted the invitation, and just before
the clock towers were striking the mystic hour he
entered the local room of the Argus. Tomlin had
phrased it correctly. The office was in full blast.
The news room immediately adjoined the city room,<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
and between the two the noise and bustle and air of
activity were confusing to one not accustomed to
that sort of thing. Telegraph instruments in two
corners of the room ticked away continuously. A
man at the long distance telephone sat in front of a
typewriter and transcribed a story that was being
sent in over the wire from a little town fifteen miles
away. The assistant city editor shouted through
the speaking tube to the foreman of the composing
room about every ten or fifteen minutes. Telegraph
boys came in every few minutes, carrying little yellow
envelopes bearing within their modest covers the
news of the entire habitable globe. The news editors
sitting at their big desks tore the wrappings
off these silent messengers, and after editing them,
put suggestive and snappy headlines over them for
the benefit of their thousands of readers of the following
morning. A dozen reporters sitting at their
desks scratched away for dear life, or pounded the
typewriters in their haste to put the words together
which were to furnish the subscribers of the Argus
with a comprehensive account of everything of interest
that had happened in the great city during the
previous twenty-four hours. Nothing was too
small, nothing too great to be gathered in this
enormous dragnet of publicity and furnished to
eager men and women with their coffee and rolls
on the following morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>Herbert was entranced with the scene. He had
already been fascinated by the smell of printers’ ink
and had a very intelligent idea of the methods of
modern journalism; but this scene wherein apparently
hopeless confusion gradually worked itself out
into perfect order and system, furnished the capstone
to his already stimulated imagination. He
longed to take an active part in it.</p>

<p>As he looked around the room his eye was attracted
to little slips of paper posted on a bulletin
board near the city editor’s desk. These informed
all who were interested, whether John Jones or
John Smith was absent or on duty; prohibited the
men from smoking in the office, and contained little
bits of poetry and anecdotes which had been surreptitiously
posted there by some of the men on the
staff. There was one thing on the bulletin board
that attracted Herbert’s attention more than anything
else. It might be called a code of fundamental
principles for the aspiring reporter. It read as follows:</p>

<p>“Be accurate, courteous, earnest, enterprising,
enthusiastic, faithful, honest, manly, modest, observant,
persevering, pleasant, prompt, quick, sensible,
shrewd, tactful, temperate.</p>

<p>“Ask plenty of questions, and don’t forget the
answers.</p>

<p>“Know all you can, but don’t know it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>“Study history, political economy, learn shorthand,
use a typewriter.</p>

<p>“Keep posted on current events; cultivate numerous
acquaintances; say little, listen much.</p>

<p>“Never violate confidence; be honest with yourself,
your employers, and the public. Have a conscience.
Don’t fake. Merit confidence. Command
respect.</p>

<p>“Know men; know facts, then write the plain
truth simply. Write plainly and avoid flub. Write
for the people. Write English. Be clear, concise,
direct.</p>

<p>“When sent for news get it, and get it right.
Accuracy, accuracy, accuracy.</p>

<p>“Never write anything you would not sign your
name to. Realize your responsibility.</p>

<p>“Never be unjust or unmanly; cultivate a pleasant
address, be persistent, but polite.</p>

<p>“Observe everything. Study human nature.
Study newspapers of different cities and make a
model of the best.</p>

<p>“Cultivate humor. Be charitable. Speak
kindly.</p>

<p>“Keep your presence of mind.</p>

<p>“Read good literature; avoid debasing associations.</p>

<p>“Hustle.”</p>

<p>After reading this, and resolving to memorize it<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
for his own benefit, Herbert went to one of the unoccupied
desks and began looking over some of the
newspapers. While he was thus engaged the assistant
city editor rushed up to him carrying a clipping
taken from one of the afternoon papers.</p>

<p>“See here, Harkins!” he shouted, “how would
you like to make yourself useful&mdash;you’re not on the
staff yet, but it won’t do you any harm to try and
get your hand in.”</p>

<p>“I’d be delighted,” said Herbert; “what is it?”</p>

<p>“Here, take this clipping,” was the reply; “it’s
from one of the afternoon papers. I’d like you to
re-write it and condense it for the Argus. Get it up
quickly. It’s for one of the inside pages, and it
must be in the composing room before one o’clock.”</p>

<p>Herbert took the clipping and read it carefully.
It told about the arrival in New York of Madame
Bonneville, a celebrated French actress, who was
coming to this country for the purpose of making
her farewell tour. There was a spirited description
of her arrival on the pier amid a cloud of
trunks, packages and dress-suit cases, not to mention
two or three bird cages, half a dozen umbrellas, a
green poll-parrot and a pet poodle dog which she
insisted on carrying in her arms and embracing in
a most motherly fashion.</p>

<p>Herbert gazed at this account long and earnestly.
It contained a brief interview with the actress, and<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
while the whole thing was intensely interesting and
human, it really contained little actual news excepting
the fact that the actress had arrived and being
wearied with her long journey, had retired immediately
to her apartments. How to re-write and reduce
this article and make it different from the
clipping, and yet retain the news and the interest,
was the problem that presented itself to the young
aspirant for journalistic honors. He got down to
work at last, however, because he felt that if a person
intended doing a thing there was nothing like
doing it. It would not be wise to theorize much
while the assistant city editor was shouting for copy.
Herbert never worked harder on any of the things
he had contributed to his own little paper in the
country than he did on the re-writing of this scrap
of New York news. After much patient labor, he
finally completed his work, and found to his satisfaction
that he had reduced the article just one-half and
still retained some semblance of a good story. He
carried it over to the assistant city editor, who
glanced at it hastily, and said sharply, without the
slightest note of explanation:</p>

<p>“Won’t do. Too long. Put it in a stick or
two.”</p>

<p>Herbert walked back to his desk rather disappointed.
He knew that the news in the article could
be put into a stick or two, but he felt instinctively<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
that the item would be robbed of all its interest.
However, he sat down once more and wrote a ten
line paragraph, which met with the approval and
acceptance of the busy assistant city editor.</p>

<p>He arose early the next morning and hunted for
a copy of the Argus with much eagerness. He
knew that the little paragraph which he had finally
turned in at his first piece of work in New York
did not amount to anything; but he could not restrain
the longing desire to see himself in print for
the first time in a metropolitan newspaper. He took
the Argus and went over it with extreme care from
the first to the last page. Nothing in the paper
escaped his keen, inquiring gaze. When he had
concluded he laid it aside with a sigh of disappointment.</p>

<p>His ten line story had not been printed.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">HERBERT MAKES A HIT AND TIDES OVER A TEMPORARY FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert was still young enough to be sensitive,
and the thought that his maiden effort in the big
city had probably found its way into the waste paper
basket was galling to his natural pride. However,
he braced himself and called at the office at noon
again, and smilingly greeted his colleagues. He
learned some things during the day, and one was a
conviction that success on a country newspaper did
not necessarily fit a man for immediate employment
on a metropolitan daily. He had a long and confidential
talk with Frank Tomlin, during the course
of which he related his experience and the fate of
his first item.</p>

<p>Tomlin laughed heartily at the recital.</p>

<p>“You can’t afford to be thin-skinned in New
York, my boy,” he replied. “Besides, you are mistaken
about your item. It was written all right,
but was crowded out in the make-up.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“I am satisfied of it. I have helped Blakeley to<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
make up the paper on more than one occasion, and
there were times when stories bigger and more important
than yours and which were in type were
thrown aside for want of space. So don’t let a little
thing like that trouble you. Persevere; do the
best you can, and don’t permit yourself to be cast
down by little incidents of this kind.”</p>

<p>Herbert thanked him for this friendly advice and
promised to profit by it. The talk caused Tomlin to
drift into a train of reminiscences.</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget my first experience in the
newspaper business in this city,” he said musingly;
“it satisfied me that enterprise, while quite valuable
in itself, is not the most important thing in the
gathering of news. I know that when I began I
was eager to accomplish great things.</p>

<p>“One morning the city editor assigned me to a
meeting of the Municipal League, and as I was leaving
the room he called out:</p>

<p>“‘See here, I want you to put a little ginger in
your articles. We want to brighten the paper up a
bit.’</p>

<p>“It was a prosy gathering. Most of the members
of the league were elderly or old men, and they
made long winded speeches and accomplished little
business. There did not seem to be much prospect
of a bright article in the ordinary report of a
meeting of this character. I decided to burlesque<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
the meeting. The result was all that could be desired.
The city editor was not ‘on’ and the story
went straight to the copy desk.</p>

<p>“The next morning I was informed the proprietor
wanted to see me. I felt at once that this
summons had something to do with my article.
When I entered the room, he looked at me curiously
and in silence for some moments.</p>

<p>“‘Did you write the meeting of the Municipal
League which appears in this morning’s paper?’</p>

<p>“‘I did,’ I answered, swelling up with pride.</p>

<p>“He was silent.</p>

<p>“‘Didn’t you like the report?’ I finally inquired.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ he said, prolonging the word in a strange
manner.</p>

<p>“‘Wasn’t it good enough?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes,’ with a peculiar laugh; ‘it was bright.’
Then turning to me he said impressively: ‘I have
no doubt in the world that the members of the
league deserve all the ridicule you cast on them, but,’
he added, ‘it should not have been printed in my
paper. I am the president of the Municipal
League.’”</p>

<p>Herbert and Tomlin remained in conversation
for a long while, and the older man regaled his companion
with a batch of very interesting stories bearing
upon the incidents that take place behind the
scenes of journalism. They walked home together<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
that night, and Herbert, feeling that Tomlin was a
man in whom he could trust and confide, confessed
to him the low condition of his finances.</p>

<p>“I thought I would get immediate employment,”
he said, “and as a consequence brought only a small
amount of money with me from the country. I
met an old acquaintance who was on his uppers and
gave him a large part of my surplus. As the result
of this and my other little expenditures, I have only
about two dollars.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to borrow anything?” said the
other, turning to him quickly; “I will be glad to
stake you if you do.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Herbert hastily, “I hope you
won’t think I introduced the subject for that purpose.
But it will be about ten days before I receive
my first pay; and in the meantime next week’s board
bill will be due and payable. I wondered whether
I could not earn a little money in the meantime.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Tomlin; “it will give you an
opportunity for showing what is in you, too. The
thing is easy enough. Write some space for the
Argus. Blakeley is always willing to accept a good
story, and if you can go out into this human whirlpool
to-morrow and fish up something a little bit out
of the ordinary he will be only too glad to print it,
and pay you for it, too.”</p>

<p>The following day, acting on the suggestion of<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
his friend, Herbert made the rounds of the city
hospitals. The usual routine stories presented themselves
at all of these institutions; but most of them
were covered by staff men, and for that reason were
not available for a special space-writer. While
Herbert was pondering over what was best to do
under the circumstances, it suddenly dawned on him
that perhaps the obvious thing might make the best
story after all. Things that were happening every
day in the week were looked upon as being trite
and trivial. If he could take one of these incidents
and lift it out of the rut and make it stand toweringly
above other incidents of a like character he
would make a hit. To think was to act. He went
to the head keeper in the next hospital and asked
to look over the book of records. Among the items
inscribed there was one which told about a patient
who had attempted suicide, but whose life would be
saved. Herbert asked whether he could obtain the
details of this story, and was told that if he applied
to one of the assistants in the main ward he might
obtain some additional information. He did obtain
more facts, and he hurried to the office, eager
to write the story. The heading was “How a
Trained Nurse Defeated Death.”</p>

<p>The introduction described how a demure little
nurse in the hospital who looked as if she might
weigh not more than one hundred pounds, started<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
on a walking match against death at five o’clock in
the evening, and finished at six o’clock in the morning&mdash;a
winner. The story went on and told how
the ambulance had brought a twenty-two year old
girl to the hospital after she had swallowed enough
opium to send three or four strong men to their
death. The poor, misguided girl who had taken the
poison on account of a case of unrequited love,
showed a strong desire to go to sleep. The little
nurse knew that if the girl closed her eyes they
would never again open in this world; so she tried
to keep her awake by slapping her on the back.</p>

<p>That method was not strenuous enough, so the
long walk was started. It was up and down the
corridor of the receiving ward, and out into the hall
and the yard. Whenever the nurse became tired she
sat down to rest for a moment; but as soon as the
girl nodded the walk was resumed. All through
the lonesome hours of the night this unique feat of
pedestrianism was continued. Daylight appeared,
and still the walk went on. Finally the clock struck
six, and the two women were still walking. Shortly
after that the house physician made his appearance,
and giving the girl a careful examination, pronounced
her out of danger. Then, and not until
then, the nurse went to sleep, and even while Herbert
was writing his picturesque story she was still
sleeping the sleep of the just and the brave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>His story made over a column in the Argus. It
proved to be a palpable hit. Blakeley, the city editor,
who did not see it until he picked up the paper
the next morning, gloated over it with the glee with
which a miser examines a newly found diamond.
He patted Herbert on the back and said that if he
continued to turn in stories of that character his
period of probation would be short indeed and his
permanence on the paper assured.</p>

<p>But the best feature of the incident, to Herbert’s
mind, came on Friday afternoon, when he called at
the business office and received a check for $8 for
his piece of special reporting. This gave him a total
cash balance of $10 and enabled him to pay his
board bill and to look forward with confidence to the
coming of his regular pay-days.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH HERBERT IS GIVEN AN UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF</span></h2>
</div>


<p>After he had been on the Argus for about a
month, Herbert felt entirely at home. He managed
to get along very smoothly with all the members of
the staff. Blakeley, the city editor, was especially
pleased with the new addition to his local force. He
found that he was punctual, industrious and anxious
to do his work to the very best of his ability. The
other reporters at the same time looked on him as an
agreeable fellow who was willing to do them a good
turn whenever he had the chance to do so. At the
end of his second month on the paper he was gratified
at the receipt of an unsolicited increase in his
salary. His particular friend on the Argus, Francis
Tomlin, obtained a promotion at the same time;
and the two young men put their heads together
and decided to seek a pleasant room near the office.
After a search that consumed nearly all the idle
hours of a whole week, they finally obtained an
apartment which had the added advantage of a neat
and well kept bath-room. Herbert lost no time in<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
removing his effects from the modest quarters which
he had occupied since his first arrival in New York.
The two young men were together very much, and
the fact that they were employed at night and had
many hours of leisure during the day gave them the
chance of strolling about the city or seeking amusements
together at a time when most other men were
busily engaged in their trades and professions.</p>

<p>The new room, which was comfortably furnished
in the first place, rapidly grew more habitable
through the skill and good taste of the two reporters.
The gift of a set of books from home first
gave Herbert the idea of accumulating a library.
Tomlin joined with him, and in a surprisingly short
time they were the possessors of quite a valuable
little library which counted among its principal assets
several important books of reference.</p>

<p>One day Herbert was delighted to receive a visit
from Mr. Anderson, who had been his school-teacher
for so many years in Cleverly. In honor of the
event he begged off from the office for the night,
and secured a similar privilege for Tomlin. The
three men sat in the room till long past midnight,
chatting about books and newspapers and other
topics of a congenial nature. Mr. Anderson told
the story of “barring out day” at the school in
Cleverly, and the recital was done so well that it
filled Tomlin with delight and caused him to laugh<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
with such heartiness that the tears fairly ran down
his cheeks.</p>

<p>On another occasion a little later in the year
Noah Brooks, the editor of the Cleverly Banner,
visited New York, and while in the city was the
guest of Herbert Harkins. The young man was
very much pleased at the thought of entertaining the
veteran editor, who had been such a good friend
to him in Cleverly. He took Tomlin into his confidence,
and between them they planned a program
which kept Mr. Brooks engaged every minute of the
day and night during his four days’ stay in the
metropolis. In fact Herbert exhausted his resources
in showing the visitor what he was pleased
to call “the time of his life.” As the three men
walked along Broadway together, Mr. Brooks looking
up at the high buildings on either side of him,
said musingly:</p>

<p>“Herbert, it’s been over forty years since I visited
this town before, and I want to say that there have
been many changes since then.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” replied Herbert, with a laugh;
“in fact, although I have been here only a few
months I can see changes that are going on at the
present time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, many changes,” assented the old editor,
nodding his head in a reflective manner; “and these
changes are not only in the big buildings, but in the<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
big men. I may be mistaken, but I don’t think you
produce the kind of men that we had in the days
when I was in my prime. However, I won’t insist
on that. It may simply be the natural thought of
every old man.”</p>

<p>“Who would you regard as the most conspicuous
man that was here when you visited the city last?”
asked Herbert, anxious to draw upon his friend’s
inexhaustible fund of recollections.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “that’s a pretty hard question
to answer after all these years; but I think that
perhaps good old Horace Greeley was the best of
them all. When I was here last I met him in the
flesh. Now all that you have of him is that statue
in front of the Tribune Building and the memory
of his honest, old fashioned life.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman sighed at this as if he were not
quite sure that the good old times would ever come
again. Indeed he was a type of man very similar
to the famous editor, whom he was accustomed to
look upon as the greatest man of his day and generation.
Mr. Brooks was careless in his dress,
quaint in his manner and unyielding in his integrity.
Tomlin enjoyed the visit of the country editor,
if anything, more than Herbert; and he was
really sorry when the trip came to an end, and he
went with Herbert to the depot to bid good-by to the
whole-souled old man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>In the meantime Herbert continued to make satisfactory
progress in the Argus office. He was receiving
all kinds of assignments now, and he soon
had the reputation of being a man who did his work
perfectly. More than this, he was marked down as
a reliable reporter, which is a very important thing
on any newspaper. The city editor felt that when
an assignment was placed in his hand it was sure
to be covered and the copy turned in at the earliest
possible moment. One morning as they were leaving
the house together, Tomlin said to Herbert:</p>

<p>“Some day, old man, you will get a very big
thing to do, and it may be the means of either making
or breaking you.”</p>

<p>The occasion came sooner than expected. That
very morning the city editor summoned Herbert to
his private office, and said:</p>

<p>“See here, Harkins, I am going to give you a
chance to show what there is in you. I have here
what I regard as a very delicate and difficult
piece of work. It requires perseverance, and I am
willing to give you the job if you will tell me that
you will stick at it and never quit until your efforts
have been crowned with success. Can you give me
that promise?”</p>

<p>Herbert smiled at this vigorous presentation of
the case, and said:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Blakeley, if it is a piece of newspaper<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
work that comes within my ability, I feel reasonably
sure of coming out successful.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other, in his short, snappy tones,
“here is a letter. It’s a small clue as a starting
point. Read it over, and then come back to me.”</p>

<p>Herbert went to his desk and read the letter as
directed. It was from a poor woman who had been
induced to send $2 of her hard earned money to a
concern which promised to teach her how to paint
on china within two weeks, and after that time to
furnish her with steady employment which would
pay her anywhere from $10 to $20 a week, according
to her speed and ability. She said in her letter
that she had sent the money, and in return received
a flimsy circular which gave some crude and utterly
impracticable directions of how to paint. The thing
was worthless to her and her $2 wasted.</p>

<p>When Herbert had finished reading this, he returned
to Blakeley and said:</p>

<p>“Have you any further directions?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply, “you will have to work on
your own resources from now on. I suppose that
eventually the postal authorities will hear of this
swindle and refuse to permit this sort of thing to
go through the mails; but in the meantime we know
about it and we want to get the credit of stopping it
at once. You take the address of this woman and
go ahead and see what you can make of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>Herbert called upon the woman that afternoon,
and in less than an hour had obtained a very good
story from her, backed up by a sworn statement of
her experience with the concern. At the same time
he learned the names and addresses of ten other persons
who had been swindled in a similar manner.
Altogether four days were consumed in visiting and
interviewing these persons. Some of them who had
natural ability, had learned to paint on china in spite
of the bungling directions sent out by the concern;
but when they wrote to the company and asked for
the employment that was to pay them from $10 to
$20 a week their letters were ignored. Altogether
the young reporter had what might be called a first
class story. When he had all of his facts in good
shape he went to the city editor again, and said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Blakeley, I want you to give me authority
to employ a private detective. I have everything
in perfect condition at present, and all I need is the
climax, which I hope to bring about at noon to-morrow.
In other words, it is necessary to arrest
someone connected with this concern. If we do
this, I will have plenty of witnesses, and we can
have the scoundrel held for court.”</p>

<p>“Capital! Capital!” shouted Blakeley. “I
will give you the authority to employ a detective at
once. How do you propose going about it?”</p>

<p>“That is quite simple,” answered Herbert; “the<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
company has a box in the post office. I have sent
a decoy letter, which should be placed in the box
between eleven and twelve o’clock to-morrow.
They probably employ a go-between, or a messenger,
who gathers up the letters and takes them to
the head swindler. We must arrest this person,
whoever he is, and probably with a little ingenuity
we may be able to extort a confession from him, and
then go after the other fellows. In the meantime
I am going back to my room and will start to typewrite
the story. I have it blocked out, so that we
can make a full page scare out of it. We ought to
have a picture of the man who comes after the letters,
and then, if possible, a photograph of the head
swindler, and interviews with all the victims.”</p>

<p>Blakeley looked at the young man with admiration
written in every line of his countenance. He put
out his short, pudgy hand, and slapped Herbert on
the back.</p>

<p>“Harkins, you are all right. You’ll do. Go
ahead, my boy, and I wish you luck in your undertaking.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH HERBERT DOES SOME VERY HARD WORK AND RECEIVES A TERRIBLE SHOCK</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert arose much earlier than usual the next
morning, for he had a keen appreciation of the important
character of the work that lay before him.
He had hardly finished his breakfast when there was
a ring at the door and the landlady brought up a
card which bore upon its glazed surface the simple
inscription “M. Short.” Herbert wondered who
this could be, but directed that he be sent up to his
room at once. A few minutes later he was greeting
a short-set, stockily-built man, with sharp eyes and
a sad expression of countenance.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Short,” said Herbert, “what can I
do for you?”</p>

<p>The bright eyes of the little man twinkled merrily
as he responded:</p>

<p>“I fear that I will have to put the shoe on the
other foot and kindly inquire what I can do for
you.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Herbert, “I never met you before.”</p>

<p>“Probably not,” replied the other, still smiling;<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
“but I was ordered to report to you this morning,
and told that you would give me directions how to
proceed.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Herbert, a light breaking in on
him, “you are the detective.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the other mildly, “that is my business,
and I am now at your service.”</p>

<p>After a conversation of ten or fifteen minutes, the
reporter and the detective came to a thorough understanding.
They were to meet at the main post
office shortly before noon, and their movements after
that were to depend entirely upon circumstances.
Herbert was pleased with the character of man who
had been sent to assist him, and mentally congratulated
himself upon what now appeared to be the
certain success of many days of hard labor. The
end was already in view.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the detective had taken his
leave, Herbert received a square cornered envelope,
containing his name and address. He tore it open
quickly and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Herbert</span>:</p>

<p>“Father, mother and I have removed to New
York for the winter, and would be glad to have you
call at the earliest opportunity. We understand
that you are engaged in your newspaper work in
the evening, so that if you care you are quite welcome<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
to call in the morning, or at any other time
that may suit your convenience.</p>

<p class="ir1"><span style="padding-right:2em">“Very sincerely yours,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Mary Black</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Herbert looked at his watch. He had nearly
three hours to spare before it would be time to
keep his appointment with the detective in the post
office, and he quickly decided to utilize it by making
a hurried call on the Blacks. The address given
was that of a house on West 69th Street, and in a
very short time, by making use of the sub-way, Herbert
found himself at the address indicated.</p>

<p>Mary Black, who responded to his call, was delighted
to see her old friend and schoolmate, and in
a few minutes he was also talking with Mr. and
Mrs. Black. The family, distressed by the continued
absence of the son and brother, had determined
to stay in New York for some months in
the hope of obtaining some clue to the runaway. A
financial friend of Mr. Black, who had gone to
Europe for the winter, had insisted upon his occupancy
of the house during the time that he was
absent from the country. Although the suggestion
had been made only a fortnight before, the little
family was already comfortably installed in the
69th Street house. They were all delighted with
their new surroundings, and Mary was very much<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
pleased and interested with the sights of the big
city; but over it all there was a certain sadness
caused by the sorrow which was felt on account of
the erring one. The father was almost completely
crushed at the domestic affliction which overshadowed
their hearthstone. He had lost the coldness
and haughtiness for which he was distinguished
while at Cleverly, and in broken tones expressed to
Herbert the sorrow he felt at the injustice which he
had done to his old friend, David Harkins. He
said that if an opportunity should ever come whereby
he would be enabled to remedy the ill that had
been caused through his thoughtless words, he would
cheerfully do so.</p>

<p>Time passed so rapidly and so pleasantly in the
company of Mary Black that Herbert was loath to
leave. A look at his watch, however, showed that
he had less than an hour before the time would arrive
for keeping his appointment, so he bade good-by
to Mr. and Mrs. Black and hurried towards the
door. Mary accompanied him there, and he noticed
from her constrained manner that she had something
on her mind and was anxious to speak to him
privately. Being a man, he felt that it was incumbent
upon him to break the ice, so he said gently:</p>

<p>“Mary, is there anything I can do for you or
your father or mother? If so, don’t hesitate to
speak to me frankly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<p>“There is something, Herbert,” she said, “and
it has been weighing upon my mind for a long
while. It is about Arthur. I want you to promise
me that you will be a friend to my brother. I do
not believe that he is a bad boy at heart; but unfortunately,
he has fallen into bad company and
has been led astray. Promise me that if the opportunity
ever presents itself, you will give him a
helping hand. This chance may come, or it may
never come; but tell me that you will not forget
what I have said to you.”</p>

<p>Herbert took her by the hand, and said with
much solemnity:</p>

<p>“Mary, if I ever meet Arthur and have the opportunity
of befriending him, I promise you that I
shall do so.”</p>

<p>Her eyelashes were wet with tears; but at his
words, her eyes sparkled with satisfaction, and she
exclaimed eagerly:</p>

<p>“Oh, I thank you so much for saying that, because
I know that I can trust you, and I know that
you mean what you say.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Herbert was once more in
the sub-way, speeding towards the Park Row station,
which was within a short distance of the main
post office building. He reached that busy spot at
ten minutes of twelve o’clock and found the detective
awaiting him. The two men held a hurried<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
interview with the clerk of the box department,
who informed them that he knew the young man
who was in the habit of calling for the letters for
the swindling concern which they now had under
suspicion. He said that he would remain at his
post for the next fifteen or twenty minutes and as
soon as he identified the fellow he would give the
two men a signal by holding up his right hand.
The details of the plan having been arranged, the
reporter and the detective set themselves to wait
for the critical moment. It proved to be a great
strain on all concerned. The hands of the big
clock moved around so slowly that they could almost
have shrieked out with impatience and anxiety.
A great crowd was hurrying to and fro and opening
and closing the letter boxes, which reached almost
from the pavement to the ceiling all along the
great corridor, but the moments dragged by and the
clerk had made no signal.</p>

<p>Presently a man wearing a long ulster and a
derby hat stooped down on one knee and began
opening the letter box which contained the mail
belonging to the china painting concern. He entered
so quickly that neither Herbert nor the detective
caught a glimpse of his face. The box clerk
inside the office became very much excited when
the man stooped down, and getting a good look at
his face, raised his hand and shook it in the air as<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
a signal to those on the outside. It said just as
clearly as if the words had been spoken:</p>

<p>“There is your man. Nab him.”</p>

<p>The detective moved to one side so that he could
arrest his man the minute he arose from his sitting
position. Herbert, who was becoming quite nervous
from the strain, motioned the detective to
step back a few yards. When this had been done,
the young reporter got immediately in the rear of
the kneeling man so that when he arose he could
face him and make his accusation as dramatically
as possible. He felt that this was to be a great
occasion in his journalistic life, and he wanted it
to come off successfully and without the slightest
slip.</p>

<p>The man in the ulster was terribly slow about
his work. His head and his face were so close to
the box that it was impossible to get a glimpse of
his countenance. Besides he fingered each letter
separately as if to feel and mentally calculate the
amount of money enclosed in each of the envelopes.
The action did not escape Herbert’s attention, and
caused him to curl his lips up in a look of unutterable
scorn.</p>

<p>“Calculating his stealings,” he muttered to himself
indignantly; “considering how much money
he has filched from poor girls and women who
have scarcely enough to buy food to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>The kneeling figure, however, knew nothing of
the contempt with which he was being regarded by
the warm-blooded young man behind him. Presently
he finished his examination of the letters and
had put them all in the little leather gripsack which
he had beside him. He arose very slowly, and then
turned around and came face to face with the
young reporter.</p>

<p>The sight that met the gaze of Herbert Harkins
caused him to become as pale as a sheet. His head
seemed to be reeling around him, and he felt as if
he could scarcely stand without support.</p>

<p>He looked again. The second glance only confirmed
what he had seen at first.</p>

<p>The youth who stood before him was Arthur
Black!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH HERBERT LOSES HIS POSITION AND RETIRES IN DISGRACE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The shock of discovering Arthur Black so unexpectedly
and under such damaging circumstances
completely unnerved Herbert Harkins. For
many seconds he stood there staring at Arthur as
if he were some ghostly phantom who had suddenly
appeared from the grave. By degrees Herbert
began to realize the compromising position in
which he had placed himself. The detective stood
only a few yards away eagerly watching the scene
and awaiting the moment when he would be called
upon to place Arthur Black under arrest. Herbert
did not turn around, but felt that the sleuth was
there, ready to perform the act which was to be the
capstone of a remarkably clever piece of newspaper
work.</p>

<p>In that brief period of time his mind traveled
with lightning like rapidity. He thought of his
troubles in the country. He remembered the incident
when he had punished Arthur. He recalled
the threatened disgrace which had preceded his<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
father’s sudden death. He remembered his work
on the Cleverly Banner, and then by easy stages
his mind reverted to his arrival in New York, his
employment on the Argus, and finally to his meeting
with Mary Black on that very morning. He
thought of Blakeley, the city editor, impatiently
waiting for the announcement that his big story
was to be a success and that the Argus could pride
itself not only upon a notable scoop, but also upon
the exposure of a set of swindlers who had preyed
remorselessly upon the public.</p>

<p>What should he do? His duty seemed clear and
unavoidable. Surely one would have to suffer for
the benefit of the many. Besides that the eyes of
the detective were upon him, and his failure to do
the right thing at this moment might lead to his
complete downfall. From this thought his mind
reverted to every detail of the impressive interview
which he had held with Mary Black a little more
than an hour before. A voice within him urged
him to be faithful to his promise, no matter what
personal loss he might suffer. He had given her
his pledge that if he ever met Arthur Black he
would lend him a helping hand; that if he was in
trouble he would succor him; that if he was in danger
he would save him. For what seemed to be a
very long time he was torn with conflicting emotions.
Many minutes seemed to elapse&mdash;in reality<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
it was only a few seconds. He reached his decision
quickly, and he acted promptly. Putting his
arm on Arthur’s shoulder, he whispered, almost
hissed, into the latter’s ear:</p>

<p>“You are on the verge of ruin. I have been sent
here to arrest you. A detective is standing a few
yards away. If you wish to avoid arrest, exposure
and disgrace, run&mdash;run for your life.”</p>

<p>Arthur clutched convulsively at the grip in his
right hand and gave a hurried look about him.
His glance fell upon the short, stockily built man
with the little twinkling eyes, who stood only a
few yards distant. Some instinct seemed to tell
Arthur that this was the detective, that this was
the one man he should avoid. As quick as thought,
he turned on his heel and made a dash in the opposite
direction. The detective noting the movement,
started to follow him; but Herbert shouldering his
way against some people who were standing between
them, got in front of the detective and completely
blocked his way.</p>

<p>“Move aside,” said the officer angrily, “don’t
you see that that fellow is getting away? Move
aside, I tell you!”</p>

<p>By this time the crowd in the corridor had become
so dense that it was almost impassable. It
was quite evident that Arthur had made his escape
and in all probability was now out of harm’s way.<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
Herbert turned to the detective and said in a low
tone:</p>

<p>“It’s the wrong fellow, old man; it’s all a mistake.”</p>

<p>The little twinkling eyes looked searchingly into
Herbert’s face. What he saw there satisfied him.
The pale face, the look of despair, the nervous manner
were sufficient to indicate that the young man
had just passed through a crisis. It would be useless
to argue with him. The detective did not attempt
it. He buttoned up his coat, pulled his hat
down more firmly over his head, and walked away,
muttering:</p>

<p>“Well, this is the queerest game I’ve ever been
up against in all my career.”</p>

<p>After the detective left him, Herbert moved over
to one of the big windows in the post office corridor,
and leaning his elbows on the sill, stood there
for some time musing upon the incidents that had
just occurred. He recalled with a feeling of sadness
Tomlin’s prophetic words: “An opportunity
may come to you to do some big bit of work, and
it will either break you or make you.”</p>

<p>The opportunity had come much quicker than
he had anticipated, and unless all signs failed it
would prove to be the cause of his undoing. He
wondered in a numb sort of way how he was ever
going to face Blakeley. He had started out on this<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
assignment with a great display of enthusiasm. Indeed,
now that he looked back upon it he had acted
with considerable presumption. He had as good as
boasted of the ease with which he intended to
handle the case, and now it was all ended in an
inglorious fizzle. The thought of a face to face
encounter with Blakeley was decidedly chilling.
Blakeley, while possessing many charming personal
traits, was one of the hardest taskmasters in the
office. Herbert shrank at the thought of going before
him without the coveted story. He even contemplated
the notion of not returning to the office
at all; but this bit of cowardice was soon overcome
as a thought not to be seriously considered for an
instant. He would return to the office; he would
face the music like a man; and he would take his
medicine&mdash;no matter how bitter&mdash;without making
any faces.</p>

<p>He left the post office building to go to the
Argus office; but somehow or other he could not
summon up sufficient courage to undergo the dreadful
ordeal; so he walked up Broadway, mingling
with the crowd, looking in the shop windows and
trying to forget the terrible details of the most unpleasant
incident of his life. After awhile he turned
off Broadway and walked in the direction of Fifth
Avenue. When he had reached that fashionable
thoroughfare he bent his footsteps towards Central<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
Park. By this time it was late in the afternoon.
The fashionable turnouts of the rich and the prosperous
were going up the avenue, skilfully guided
through the crowded street by richly liveried drivers
who seemed to know every inch of the ground.
Still Herbert walked on and on, seemingly unconscious
of what he was doing. The approach of
dusk brought him to his senses. He must go to the
office and go there as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>He jumped on a ’bus that was going down-town,
and at the intersection where the Avenue joins
Broadway he alighted and boarded one of the surface
cars. It was quite dusk when he reached the
Argus office, and walking into the local room in an
uncertain manner, he noticed that most of the men
were out and that Blakeley was seated at his desk
alone. The city editor was puffing at a big cigar,
and did not notice the entrance of the young reporter.</p>

<p>Herbert was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Mr. Blakeley,” he said, in a hushed sort of
voice.</p>

<p>The city editor turned around like a flash.</p>

<p>“Hello there, Harkins,” he said eagerly; “I’ve
been waiting for you all the afternoon. How did
the thing pan out?”</p>

<p>“It didn’t pan out at all,” said Herbert in a hesitating,
halting way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” cried the other, his tone
perceptibly hardening.</p>

<p>“I mean that I have no story,” this in a slightly
firmer voice.</p>

<p>“No story?” shouted the other, “why what are
you talking about anyhow? There must be a
story.”</p>

<p>“There was a story,” rejoined Herbert, now
throwing all precaution to the winds; “but I can’t
write it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t write it? Why, you’re crazy, man.
What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>The city editor was thoroughly angry now. He
arose from his chair and stood towering before
Herbert. In his rage he threw his freshly lighted
cigar into the cuspidor with a savage movement of
his hand. He stamped his foot on the floor fiercely.</p>

<p>“There is no use talking about this matter any
longer. You go to your desk and write this thing
and have your copy ready as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“I can’t write it,” said Herbert, now speaking
in a voice that was scarcely audible.</p>

<p>Blakeley was silent, trying hard to control his
rising passion. When he spoke his voice sounded
almost like a hiss.</p>

<p>“You understand what this means, don’t you&mdash;you
know what it will cost you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Herbert, looking up; “I understand,<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
and I resign my position as a reporter on
the Argus.”</p>

<p>“Your resignation is accepted,” said the other
shortly; “but I call upon you to do the work that
you were assigned to perform, before leaving this
office.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it,” said Herbert; “on my honor I
cannot do it.”</p>

<p>“But what explanation have you to give?”</p>

<p>Herbert looked up helplessly. For a moment a
desire to tell the whole story to Blakeley took possession
of him. The next minute it was dismissed
as impracticable. Blakeley was a man without any
heart or feeling. He felt convinced of this, and felt
likewise that if the facts were once in the city editor’s
possession the story would have to be written
regardless of the private anguish it might cause.
So he stood there speechless before his superior.</p>

<p>“Go!” finally shouted Blakeley, pointing to the
door. “But when you go remember that you go
in disgrace. You are like an engineer who would
leave his train in the middle of the journey, or a
pilot who would desert his ship in a storm at sea.
Go, and never let me see you again.”</p>

<p>Herbert left the room with a flushed face and
downcast eyes. He avoided the elevator. The
thought of meeting with anyone at a time like this
grated upon his feelings. He walked down the<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
stairway with a heart as heavy as lead. He felt
mortified and angry by turns. He mentally blamed
Blakeley for his coarse manner and the ugly scolding
he had given him. The next second he admitted
to himself that Blakeley was fully justified in
what he had said and done. Indeed, from the standpoint
of the news and of duty, he could find no possible
justification for his own conduct.</p>

<p>Presently he got out into Park Row and was
soon in the midst of the pushing, bustling crowd.
It was quite dark now, and the rush to the bridge
was at its height. Myriads of electric lights shone
brightly all about him. Cars rushed by, with motormen
sounding their gongs continuously. Wagon
drivers shouted and shrieked and pulled at their
horses, and thousands of pedestrians laughed and
shouted as they hurriedly went their way. Herbert,
in a vague sort of way, wondered how they could
all be so happy when he felt so miserable. Nothing
seemed the same to him. Some mysterious change
appeared to have overcome the face of New York
since he had left his home early that morning; but
in reality things moved on as before. Herbert’s
philosophy did not realize that the world moves on
day by day and night by night, regardless of the
joys or the woes of the individual.</p>

<p>He soon reached his lodgings and quietly let
himself in the door by means of his latch-key. He<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
struck a light and gazed about curiously at the
familiar things in the little apartment. Everything
in the room seemed to look at him in a reproachful
manner. Strange as it may seem, it was some
moments before he became accustomed to being
alone. Then he picked up a book and tried to read;
but it was a dismal failure. He walked the floor
for a long, long while. There was a lump in his
throat that he could not remove. Presently he sank
down into a chair and dropped his bowed head into
his hands on the table.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost my job,” he groaned to himself. “I’ve
done more than that. I’ve not only lost my place,
but I’ve been retired in disgrace.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE YOUNG REPORTER FINDS THAT THE DOOR OF OPPORTUNITY IS BARRED TO HIM</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert sat in the darkened room with his head
bowed on the table for a very long while, thinking
of the events that had taken place the previous
twenty-four hours. First he was angry with himself
for what he had done, and then felt humiliated
at permitting Blakeley to abuse him in such a cruel
manner; but with second thought came the conviction
that even if he had it to go over again he
would not have acted in a different manner. To
have written the story even with Arthur at liberty
would have meant lasting disgrace to Mary Black
and her parents. He had paid a very dear price,
but had averted that, which after all, was a very
consoling thing. While he sat there Tomlin came
into the room in his impetuous manner. He rushed
over to Herbert and clapped him on the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Brace up, old man; don’t sit here and mope as
if you had lost your last friend in the world.”</p>

<p>Herbert looked up at him and tried to smile; but
the effort was a very sickly one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>Tomlin sat down beside his friend, and becoming
serious, said:</p>

<p>“See here, old chap, I don’t want to pry into
your affairs, but why in the world did you throw
Blakeley down in that cold-blooded fashion?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t throw Blakeley down,” began Herbert
angrily.</p>

<p>But the other man held up his hand to stay the
hot words, and replied in a low voice:</p>

<p>“But you did throw him down, and there is no
possible way of proving anything to the contrary.
Now you must have had a reason, and if you care to
give it to me, I’ll be glad to listen.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t consider me rude, or lacking
in friendship,” replied Herbert; “but really the circumstances
make it impossible for me to tell you
why I acted as I did.”</p>

<p>“All right, old fellow,” rejoined Tomlin, slapping
Herbert on the back again; “I am satisfied
whether you tell me or not. I believe in you and
that is sufficient.”</p>

<p>Shortly before noon the following day Herbert
went to the office of the New York Sentinel and
presented his card to the city editor. That individual
sat in his roll-top chair and gazed at the bit
of pasteboard musingly:</p>

<p>“So you want a job, do you? Well, I have heard
of your name before, and I understand that you<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
have done some creditable work. I might make a
place for you here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Could you?” inquired Herbert eagerly; “I’m
sure if you would give me the chance I’d make
good.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it,” said the city editor. Then as
if the thought had just struck him: “By the way,
how did you come to leave the Argus?”</p>

<p>Herbert flushed up at this, and the fact did not
escape the attention of the keen-witted city editor
of the Sentinel. He scrutinized his visitor with a
steady eye. Herbert hesitated for some seconds,
and then said slowly:</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth, that is a personal matter
that I cannot explain.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the other slowly, “that rests
with you entirely.”</p>

<p>“Can I have the position?” inquired Herbert.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other, rubbing his hand over
his face and speaking slower than before, “I think
you had better come in and see me again in the
course of a day or so.”</p>

<p>This was not very satisfactory, but Herbert had
to make the best of it. He returned to his room for
the purpose of writing some letters and later on
took a walk. Two days after this incident he called
at the Sentinel office, but found, to his disappointment,
that the city editor was out of the city. Another<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
day elapsed, and this time the man he was in
search of was at his desk.</p>

<p>“Do you find that you will be able to employ me
on the Sentinel?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p>“No,” said the city editor decidedly; “no, I cannot
find room for you.”</p>

<p>“Is there any special reason for that decision?”
asked Herbert with a sinking sensation in the region
of the heart.</p>

<p>“Well,” yawned the city editor, stretching his
arms over his head, “I don’t know that I should
answer that question; but I will say that I had a
talk with Blakeley, the city editor of the Argus,
yesterday afternoon. You can draw your own conclusions.”</p>

<p>Herbert did, and found that the conclusions were
not very flattering to himself. In the course of the
next two weeks he visited the local rooms of nearly
every important newspaper in the city; but everywhere
he met with the same experience. In short,
he found himself blacklisted.</p>

<p>In the meantime he made every effort to preserve
a cheerful demeanor. He wrote long letters
home to his mother, but never mentioned the grave
disaster which had overwhelmed him and which
threatened to blight his future newspaper life. Fortunately
he possessed a small sum of money which
was on deposit in the saving fund. He had been<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
prudent and thrifty from the time of his arrival in
New York, and as a consequence was able to save
small amounts of money in addition to the allowance
which he sent to his mother with religious regularity.
He drew this out now, and counting it
over carefully found that, if necessary, it would be
sufficient to pay his expenses for a month or so.
But after all a month, and even two months pass
very rapidly to a poor man who sees no immediate
prospect of earning money. He noted with dismay
that a whole week had been lost in his fruitless
negotiations with the Sentinel, and that a longer
period of time had passed by during the time he was
applying to the other newspapers.</p>

<p>At this period he received a letter from Noah
Brooks, saying that Mr. Anderson had told him of
the big beat upon which he was working for the
Argus, and wanting to know whether he had been
able to carry it to a successful conclusion. The letter
annoyed him, even coming from such an old
and valued friend as the editor of the Cleverly Banner.
However, he sent a courteous reply to his
old friend, expressing regret at his failure to distinguish
himself upon that particular piece of work.</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson, his former teacher, hearing that
he had separated from the service of the Argus,
called on him one evening.</p>

<p>“I am awfully sorry to hear this, Herbert, and I<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
half suspect that it is the result of a quarrel with
Blakeley.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Herbert with a half smile,
“there is no doubt about that. Blakeley quarreled
all right. I think it was a one-sided quarrel; but
there is no use in discussing it now.”</p>

<p>“But there is use,” insisted the other; “I’ll go
to see Blakeley at once and have this matter
straightened out.”</p>

<p>Herbert put a detaining hand on his arm, and
said with great earnestness:</p>

<p>“Please don’t do anything of the kind.”</p>

<p>“But I will,” cried the other.</p>

<p>“But you must not,” corrected Herbert; “if you
carry out your good intentions you will do me a
great deal of harm. If you are really a friend of
mine, I beg of you to stay away from the Argus
office.”</p>

<p>“But, my young man,” said the teacher, “you
are entirely too young to be so self opinionated.
You should not have quarreled with Blakeley. It
would have been much better if you had bent your
will to his.”</p>

<p>Herbert shook his head sadly. He was silent for
a few moments, and then said with much gravity:</p>

<p>“You mean very well, but you cannot mend matters
in this instance.”</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson left the house looking very forlorn.<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
He was anxious to help Herbert, and keenly
felt his inability to do so.</p>

<p>Tomlin had been sent out on an assignment that
took him to a remote part of the State. He remained
away for a week, and Herbert was alone
during all that period. Tomlin returned unexpectedly
one evening, very anxious to hear the latest
news regarding his friend and the papers. Herbert
came in late that night. His white face, drooping
mouth and hopeless eyes told their own story to
Tomlin. However he tried to disguise the feeling
that was within him, and said with assumed cheerfulness:</p>

<p>“Well, old boy, how have you made out in my
absence? Have you tried any of the other papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Herbert, “I have.”</p>

<p>“Which one?”</p>

<p>“Everyone,” said Herbert with a bitter smile,
“at least everyone that is worth considering.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are your prospects?”</p>

<p>“I have no prospects.”</p>

<p>“No prospects&mdash;not even in the future?”</p>

<p>“No,” retorted Herbert, the anger in his heart
making him raise his voice to a high pitch; “not
even in the future. To be plain with you, Tomlin,
they all know about the circumstances under which
I left the Argus, and they refuse to have anything
to do with me. I am blacklisted. Do you understand<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
that? I am blacklisted, and a disgraced
man.”</p>

<p>The tone of Herbert’s voice no less than what he
said shocked Tomlin very much; but he made no
reply, and the two friends sat there for many minutes
staring mutely at each other.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">WHEREIN A BLACK SHEEP SHOWS A DESIRE TO CHANGE HIS COLOR</span></h2>
</div>


<p>One morning not long after the conversation
which has been recorded in the previous chapter,
Tomlin said to Herbert:</p>

<p>“See here, old chap, you are not going to throw
up the sponge&mdash;I know you’re not. You’ve got
too much grit and pluck for any such thing as that.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Herbert, staring
at him in an unmeaning way.</p>

<p>“What do I mean? I mean that you’ve got to
employ strategy. When a soldier gets in a tight
fix with the enemy, he uses the brains with which
he is endowed for the purpose of extricating himself.
So it is with the lawyer, with the business
man and with mortals generally&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What in the world are you driving at?” interrupted
Herbert.</p>

<p>“I know what I’m driving at,” replied the other.
“Listen to what I have to say, and then try to
answer me intelligently. Can you write a good
Sunday newspaper story?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>“Can I? Why you know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course I know,” cut in Tomlin,
“I only asked you that question as a matter of
form. I want you to go out and get a first-class
special story. Write it up in your most attractive
style, typewrite it on the machine we have in this
room, and give it to me by this time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The hearty manner of his friend furnished just
the sort of inspiration that Herbert needed at that
particular time. He went out during the day and
visited the various places where he would be likely
to obtain material for a special story. It grew quite
late and he was still without anything upon which he
could base the sort of article that would answer to
the vivid description furnished by Tomlin. On his
way back to his room he stopped at an Old Man’s
Home to enjoy a chat with the superintendent, who
had been his friend while he was on the Argus, and
had sometimes rendered him valuable assistance.</p>

<p>“Anything doing about here, Smith?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the superintendent, “not a thing.
This is the slowest week we have had for a long
while. It’s as dull as dishwater.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to hear that,” responded Herbert; “I
thought in a large community of this kind something
was always happening.”</p>

<p>“No,” responded the other, “nothing worth
printing. I’ve got a good joke on one of the old<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
fellows upstairs, however. He was knocked out by
a bat last night.”</p>

<p>“By a bat?” queried Herbert.</p>

<p>“Yes. You see the old chap was a colonel in
the Civil War&mdash;one of the bravest men that ever
led a regiment. Well, while he was reading a bat
flew into the room, and the things that happened
during the next half hour were funny enough to
make a sick cat well. The old colonel picked up his
cane and chased that bird all around the room.
The light bewildered the bat and caused it to
flounder around so blindly that half of the ornaments
in the room were broken. The colonel
thought he had it at one time, though, and lifted up
his cane to give the bird its death blow; but he
missed by a hair, and instead of killing the pesky
thing, he smashed two big vases that stood on the
mantel-piece. Then when he made another lunge
at it his stick went through an oil painting which I
believe has been in his family for nearly a hundred
years. It was daylight before that bird was thrust
out of the room, and when the first streak of dawn
penetrated into the apartment the floors and walls
resembled some place which had just finished an unsuccessful
siege with the enemy.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s a pretty good story,” cried Herbert
quickly, “and if you will give me the privilege
of talking to the old colonel and the chance to look<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
at that room, I will thank you to the day of my
death.”</p>

<p>The superintendent was only too well pleased to
do this. Herbert obtained a picture of the valiant
soldier, and borrowing a camera from one of the
inmates, made a photograph of the dismantled
room. He hurried home, and before midnight had
succeeded in grinding out an exceedingly interesting
special which was entitled “The Story of the
Union Soldier and the Bat.” He turned this over
to Tomlin in the morning, and when they met in
the evening again that young man said with a considerable
degree of self-satisfaction:</p>

<p>“Your story is accepted and will be printed, and
you will be paid for it on the first of the month.”</p>

<p>“But I&mdash;they&mdash;” began Herbert.</p>

<p>“Oh,” interrupted the other impatiently, “I
know what you are going to say. I know that you
are blacklisted, but that has nothing to do with the
case. A man must earn a living, and you have a
right to your bread and butter. Besides this is a
justifiable deception. I am going to keep on selling
your stuff as my own as long as you have wit
enough to write. The articles will be typewritten,
and the editors who buy them from me will not
know the difference except,” with a little laugh,
“they will be a little more brilliant than the kind I
am in the habit of writing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[165]</span></p>

<p>“You think it’s all right?” ventured Herbert.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s all right. Where’s the harm?
No name is signed to the articles. The newspapers
get the worth of their money. The readers are satisfied.
You are reimbursed, and I am gratified.
What more would you want?”</p>

<p>Herbert soon came around to this way of thinking,
and then and there started in on another article,
which proved equally as saleable as the first. Elated
by the success of these two articles, he planned a
series of Sunday specials, chiefly sketches of odd
phases of life in New York City. He was industry
personified, and worked so adroitly in gathering
his facts that his identity was fully concealed. One
morning, just as he was about to leave the house he
received a letter; and on tearing open the envelope,
found that it was dated from a small town in the
northern part of Connecticut. It was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Herbert</span>:</p>

<p>“I would be an ingrate of the meanest type if I
did not write to you and acknowledge the great debt
which I owe to you now, and which I will continue
to owe till the day of my death. I fully realize that
if it had not been for your interference and kindness
I would have been arrested, and myself and the
members of my family disgraced. But sometimes
bad beginnings have good results, and the merest<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
incidents prove to be the turning point in a man’s
career. I am satisfied now that the little episode
which occurred at the post office a few weeks ago is
going to prove the making of me. I know that I
have been indolent and worthless; that I was foolish
enough to contract bad and vicious associations, and
that I have been guilty of many disreputable things.
Somehow or other I went along doing these things
without thinking of the meanness that was involved
in them. Looking back upon them now, I can see
very readily how little incidents repeated many
times led to bad habits, and how these bad habits
were gradually undermining my whole character.</p>

<p>“I do not ask you to believe me, but I am going
to tell you just the same, that from the instant you
gave me the kindly warning in the post office building
I made up my mind that if I were given the
opportunity I would lead a better life in the future.
I am now making this effort with all the courage at
my command. It’s a hard job, but I believe that I
am going to come out a winner. I have secured
honest employment in this little town, and I intend
to remain here till I am fully satisfied that I am fit
to associate with manly and self-respecting persons
like yourself. Kindly consider this letter sent in
confidence, and not to be revealed till you hear from
me further.</p>

<p class="ir1"><span style="padding-right:2em">“Very truly yours,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Arthur Black</span>.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>Herbert was delighted with this missive. It repaid
him for the great sacrifice he had made&mdash;not
for Arthur Black&mdash;but for his sister. His first
thought was to call on Mary and assure her that
her brother was alive and well; but upon mature
reflection he abandoned this as being unwise. From
that day, however, Herbert put more heart into his
work. He still depended upon his voluntary contributions
to the newspapers, and while he longed
for a permanent position on the staff of one of the
large dailies, he felt that he would have to bide
his time before he reached such a desirable post.</p>

<p>During these days he often thought of his father,
and more than once he recalled the dramatic scene
when his father and the strange visitor were seated
at the table together in their little home at Cleverly.
He had frequently resolved to run out the mystery
of that night, and now he vowed it with more than
usual vehemence. Everywhere he went he tried to
discover some signs of the queer stranger. It
seemed a hopeless task, but he resolved to persist
in it till the end. One evening, while he was walking
down Cortlandt street, his gaze was attracted
by a big, broad-shouldered man who was walking
along the street four or five yards in advance of
him. There was something very familiar about
those bulky shoulders. He looked again, and as his
glance traveled upward he suddenly realized that<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
the man had a shock of bushy red hair. Recognition
was instantaneous; it was the man he had been
looking for for so long. He pushed his way through
the crowd, and at one time was almost able to
reach the mysterious person by stretching out his
hands; but at that critical moment a heavily laden
truck intervened, and the queer one gained several
yards on him. It was evident that he was making
for the ferry house to take the boat which ran to
Jersey City. Just before they reached the pier the
bell began to ring its warning signal. The crowd
hurried. The man with the red hair and the bulky
shoulders ran rapidly towards the boat, with Herbert
after him panting for breath.</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” shouted the gateman to the approaching
crowd.</p>

<p>The big man redoubled his speed, and just as he
entered the ferry slip and got aboard the bell rang
for the second time, the iron gate was slammed to
with a bang, and Herbert found himself standing
on the wharf, gazing at the boat churning its way
towards the shores of New Jersey.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">PERSISTENCE HAS ITS REWARD AND HERBERT FINALLY MEETS THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert Harkins was now consumed with a
burning desire to meet the mysterious stranger. He
had an actual interest in clearing the memory of his
father; but above and beyond that he was now filled
with a boyish curiosity which insisted upon being
satisfied. The thought of the stranger occupied his
waking hours, and even disturbed his rest at night.
When he was out of doors he stared at all the big
men he happened to meet, in order to discover, if
possible, a burly man with broad shoulders and a
shock of red hair. At times this peculiar quest
seemed so absurd that he felt like abandoning it altogether;
but such periods of depression were invariably
followed by a resolution to persevere till he
had accomplished his desire.</p>

<p>This sort of thing went on day after day without
bringing any practical results. Just when Herbert
was beginning to tire of it, the thought flashed
across his mind that publicity was frequently a way
of obtaining things that could not be found by ordinary<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
efforts. In other words, he flew to the personal
columns of the daily newspapers for assistance.
The result of this was the following advertisement
which appeared one morning in the New
York Herald:</p>

<p>“Will the stranger who called on David Harkins
at Cleverly very late one night about five years ago
kindly send his address to H. H., care of General
Delivery, Post Office. By doing so he may be the
instrument of redeeming the memory of a good
man.”</p>

<p>Herbert was very much pleased with the phrasing
of this advertisement. There was an air of
romance about it that appealed quite strongly to his
youthful fancy. The day after its appearance he
hurried to the post office with the expectation of
receiving a letter, but he was doomed to disappointment.
No reply of any kind had been received.
On the second day he called at the post office again,
and this time was rewarded by the receipt of a very
much soiled postal card. The writer informed him
that he had called on David Harkins at Cleverly
about five years ago and would be glad to meet the
person who was in quest of information. The address
given was that of a low-grade lodging house
on the Bowery. Herbert felt a trifle disappointed
at the tone of this communication, but nevertheless
resolved to run it out to the end. He visited the<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
Bowery that afternoon, and was received by a
short, stout man with a very red nose and a somewhat
husky voice.</p>

<p>“You sent me this postal card,” said Herbert,
exhibiting the square piece of manila board.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the other, with a leer, “what is
there in it for me if I give you the information you
are after?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that that has anything to do with
it,” said Herbert.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” retorted the other, with a chuckle,
“it has everything to do with it, my young chappie.
I’m a business man.”</p>

<p>“A business man?” queried Herbert.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a business man. My motto is, no cash
no information. That’s plain enough, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Too plain,” said Herbert, picking up his hat
and starting towards the door.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried the other, jumping up; “I
don’t want much from you, and I’ll tell you anything
you wish to know.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it,” replied Herbert; “but
unfortunately you are not the man I want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am,” insisted the other eagerly, “I’m
the man that called on David Harkins at Cleverly.”</p>

<p>Herbert shook his head and shrugged his shoulders;
then as if it were an afterthought, he turned
to the seedy-looking person and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>“Do you insist that you are the identical man
who called on David Harkins?”</p>

<p>“I insist,” repeated the man, trying to draw himself
up in a dignified way.</p>

<p>“Now, I am sure that I have no business with
you,” said Herbert, “because it so happens that the
man who called on David Harkins had bright red
hair&mdash;it was bushy, too, while you are almost
bald-headed and your hair is black.”</p>

<p>The fellow snickered a little at this, and said:</p>

<p>“I lost me hair durin’ a very bad attack o’ fever.”</p>

<p>Herbert could not forbear smiling himself.</p>

<p>“I suppose the color turned, too, at the same
time.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the man, “it did indeed. You
needn’t laugh. Scientific men will tell you that a
man’s hair often changes color in a single night.”</p>

<p>“Well, good-by,” said Herbert, “I’ll leave you
to settle that with the scientists.”</p>

<p>Three weeks passed by after this amusing episode
and Herbert received no further replies from
the personal that he had inserted in the Herald.
He was reading the paper one afternoon, and while
running his trained eye down the many columns of
small advertisements, happened to see his own name
in print. He looked closer, and this is what he
read:</p>

<p>“If Herbert Harkins, son of the late David Harkins,<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
of Cleverly, New Jersey, will make his whereabouts
known to the undersigned, he may learn of
something to his advantage. Write without delay
to Captain Thomas Janson, Anchor Inn, Jersey
City, N. J.”</p>

<p>Feverish with anxiety, Herbert immediately sent
a letter in response to this advertisement. Within
forty-eight hours after that he received an answer,
written in a large, sprawling hand, inviting him to
call on Captain Janson at his domicile in Jersey
City. He responded without delay. He found Anchor
Inn to be an obscure hotel in a deserted part
of the town. It was a popular resort for seafaring
men. Upon inquiry for Captain Janson, he was informed
that the Captain had removed that very
morning to a new two-story house which he had
erected on the outskirts of the city. He had left a
message for Herbert, however, giving him explicit
directions where he could find his new domicile.</p>

<p>Herbert listened very carefully, and then made
his way to the address that had been given him. He
found it to be the quaintest looking house it had
ever been his good fortune to gaze upon. The
front of it was shaped like the prow of a boat, and
under the eaves of the house was a wooden effigy of
a mermaid, shaped and painted like those used upon
sailing craft in the Eastern waters. He rang the
bell, and the call was answered by a colored youth<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
dressed up in blue clothing, with brass buttons, to
represent a cabin boy. He was ushered into a
small, low-ceilinged apartment which resembled the
captain’s quarters upon a boat. The beds on either
side of the room were fitted up to resemble bunks.
The windows had been so constructed that they
were perfect reproductions of port holes. A little
desk, a brass-rimmed clock, such as can be seen in
the cabins of pleasure yachts, a coil of rope, a large
marine glass, and cheap colored pictures of the admirals
of the United States Navy adorned the walls
of this strangely furnished room.</p>

<p>Presently the door of an adjoining apartment
opened and a big, brawny man, with the rolling gait
of a sailor, entered the room. His face was as red
as a boiled lobster; his hands were thick-skinned
and broad. He had wide shoulders and&mdash;this detail
made an immediate impression upon Herbert&mdash;he
also possessed a heavy shock of red hair. The
identification was complete. This man, beyond a
doubt, was the person who had been with his father
on that eventful night.</p>

<p>“Avast there, my hearty!” shouted the newcomer,
putting out his broad hand to meet the outstretched
palm of his caller; “what are you doing
aboard my craft?”</p>

<p>“My name is Herbert Harkins,” said the young
man, “and I came here in response to your letter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<p>The seaman stopped short with an exclamation
on the tip of his tongue. He stood in the center of
the room with his hands on his hips and rolled his
head from side to side as he stared at Herbert with
unblinking eyes. The scrutiny appeared to satisfy
him.</p>

<p>“So you’re Dave Harkins’ boy, are you? Well,
you look like him; you look like him just as he appeared
when he was a young man. You’re different
from him in some ways, but the resemblance is
there just the same. You’re more like a chip off
the old block than the old block itself. Now, boy,
take a seat on that steamer chair there, get out your
log book and tell me all about your journey through
life.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” replied Herbert, taking the proffered
seat; “I’ll do so.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” interrupted the Captain, “before
you talk about yourself, tell me about your father.”</p>

<p>“You know that father is dead?” began Herbert.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that,” answered the other, “but I
want some details about it.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll try to give them to you.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” he interrupted again, as Herbert
started to talk, “will you have a glass of grog to
wet your whistle?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Herbert, “I don’t drink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>“Good for you; you’re a good deal better without
it; but an old salt like myself couldn’t do without
his pipe and his grog, especially in his old days.”</p>

<p>Herbert then proceeded to tell the old sailor all
about his father, and when he spoke of the mysterious
midnight visit and the cloud of false rumors
that had arisen therefrom the Captain’s face clouded
and he walked up and down the floor of his little
cabin shaking his fist.</p>

<p>“The lubbers!” he shouted, “they ought to
have been tied to the mast and given a dose of a
cat o’ nine tails.”</p>

<p>Having finished this part of his narrative, Herbert
then proceeded to tell the story of his own life,
and at its conclusion the old salt put out his brawny
hand, and taking Herbert’s, gave it a hearty grasp.</p>

<p>“Your story is mighty interesting. I’m mighty
glad to hear it, and I think I am in a position to be
your friend.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” responded Herbert, “and I’m
very curious to find out the real meaning of that
midnight visit.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give it to you, my boy, and in mighty quick
order. I was a boyhood chum of your father. We
grew up together, went to school together, and one
never had a thing that wasn’t shared by the other.
I had no idea of the sea in my youth; but shortly
after I got to be a boy of about your age I was entrusted<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
with a sum of money belonging to another
person. I was a sort of trustee. In an evil moment
some fellow came along and showed me how it
would be possible to double the money without any
risk. I tried it, and lost every cent. While I was
in this condition, I was called upon to make an accounting
of the trust money. In my extremity I
went to your father and explained everything. He
gave me every penny that he had in the world in
order to make good the loss, and my reputation
was saved and I had learned a lesson that I have
never forgotten since then. I was a wild boy in
my younger days. I owed a great deal of money,
and finally determined to take to the sea as a means
of cooling down my hot blood. During the next
ten years I sailed over every part of the civilized
globe. I became a master and traded extensively in
the Chinese seas. I was fortunate, made money,
and finally came home to retire upon my savings.</p>

<p>“The first man I thought of,” said the Captain,
leaning back in his easy chair, “was Dave Harkins.
I determined to hunt him up and pay him
the few hundred dollars he had so generously given
me at a critical time in my life. I got to Cleverly
late at night; the hotel was closed so that I was
unable to secure accommodations there. The
thought struck me that I might find Harkins at
home. I went to his house, and fortunately found<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
him at a moment when he needed my help just as I
had formerly needed his. I compelled him to take
that thousand dollars, and I made a condition that
he was not to tell of my whereabouts until I got
ready to make myself known to the world. I
wanted to clear up all of my old debts and to rehabilitate
myself before my old friends before I revealed
my identity. After leaving him I went to
New York, and carrying out a program that had already
been arranged, went abroad to settle up some
business interests that I had in Liverpool. I came
back, only to hear that David Harkins was dead. I
was told that the family had moved from Cleverly,
and accepted the report without attempting to verify
it. Years went by, but I was never quite satisfied.
I hunted around in a vague sort of way to
find Harkins’ boy. Only last week it occurred to
me that a personal in the Herald might bring some
results, and thank goodness it did, because here you
are with me in the flesh.”</p>

<p>“I am very grateful to hear all of this,” said
Herbert after the old sailor had finished; “I can
assure you that it makes me very happy indeed. I
never doubted my father at any time; but it is a
great satisfaction to have the whole matter settled
and to have these painful rumors dispelled as you
have dispelled them.”</p>

<p>The Captain arose from his chair, took a turn or<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
two around the room, and then putting his arm
around Herbert’s shoulder, said:</p>

<p>“My boy, we’ll dispel them in such a way that
they’ll never be heard of again. Mark one thing
down, and mark it down plain: I’m your friend,
and your friend for life.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH A STAIN IS REMOVED FROM THE MEMORY OF AN INNOCENT MAN</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert remained with Captain Janson for several
hours. The man and the boy were mutually
attracted. After some further conversation regarding
David Harkins, the sailor said:</p>

<p>“Now tell me your story.”</p>

<p>Herbert did so as briefly and as modestly as possible.
He told of his difficulty with the Argus; but
discreetly avoided all reference to Arthur Black and
the manner in which he had saved him at the expense
of his own position.</p>

<p>“My boy,” said the Captain, when he had concluded,
“it’s all right; don’t worry about these little
things. The first thing we have to do is to straighten
out the memory of your father with the people of
Cleverly. You know how these stories stick in
small communities. My boy, we’ll hoist sail and
bear down on the port of Cleverly at once, and
when we land there we’ll let the natives know a
thing or two. We’ll let ’em know that David Harkins
was one of Nature’s noblemen, and now that<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
he’s gone to Davy Jones’ locker, he has left a
friend and a son who will take care of his memory.”</p>

<p>The following day they both took the train and
went to Cleverly. Their first visit was to the office
of the Cleverly Banner, where Captain Jansen was
introduced to Noah Brooks. The editor and the
sailor had not talked for ten minutes before they
became fast friends. Presently they were joined
by Horace Coke, the lawyer, who had always been
a friend of the Harkins family, and who was delighted
with the turn things had taken. After a
general conversation in which all hands joined, the
sailor suddenly pounded his hand on the desk, and
said earnestly:</p>

<p>“Messmates, I’m here for a purpose, and a specific
purpose. Dave Harkins was an honest man.
I want everybody else to know that fact. How can
I do it?”</p>

<p>Noah Brooks scratched his head for awhile, and
then said musingly:</p>

<p>“You might print a story in the Banner, telling
all about your visit that night, and explaining how
you came to give him those ten $100 bills. How
does that strike you?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” interrupted the lawyer, “but that
doesn’t strike me very favorably. It would look
forced. Besides everybody knows that Brooks is
a friend of Herbert Harkins, and some people<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
might be inclined to think the story was a little
overdrawn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” admitted Brooks, “but I hardly
know how you can get around it in any other way.
Besides, I would do this thing freely and voluntarily.
It is not a question of expense or money.”</p>

<p>“Money!” shouted the old sailor, “who said
anything about money? I want you to understand
that money is not to stand in the way of this business.
There isn’t any expenditure that I could
make that would help the memory of Dave Harkins
that I wouldn’t undertake.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?” asked Brooks.</p>

<p>“Of course I mean it. By the way, while I am
here I would like to do something for this town of
yours. What do you need just now?”</p>

<p>The lawyer laughed at this.</p>

<p>“You talk like a millionaire.”</p>

<p>“Well,” responded the sailor, “I am not a millionaire,
but I’ve got enough to live on and a little
over, too, and if I can make somebody else feel
happy I’m going to do it.”</p>

<p>“You asked me just now,” said the lawyer musingly,
“what you could do for the town.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Well,” responded the other, “a little fountain
in the middle of the main street wouldn’t be a bad
thing. It would be the means of slaking the thirst<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
of both man and beast. We had one there some
years ago, and it was mighty useful; but it’s worn
out now, and we have no means of replacing it.”</p>

<p>“What will it cost?” asked the sailor.</p>

<p>“Not more than two thousand dollars,” responded
Mr. Coke; “that would finish the whole
thing in first-class style.”</p>

<p>“It’s a go!” shouted the sailor, jumping up;
“get the thing up in good shape, and get it up as
quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>Then and there specifications were drawn up, advertisements
given out and the draft of a communication
made to city councils. Within thirty days the
whole thing had been completed and was ready for
dedication. On the morning fixed for the celebration
it slowly dawned on Herbert’s mind that the
sailor and the lawyer had a fixed purpose in all
that they had done, and this purpose was only now
beginning to unfold itself. He got his first inkling
of this when he noticed the little silver plate on the
side of the fountain, saying that it been erected by
Captain Thomas Janson to the memory of his lifelong
friend, David Harkins.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harkins wept a great deal when she saw
this plate, which was a very good thing for her,
because it relieved her pent up feelings and enabled
her to recall memories of the dead without doing
her any serious injury. Herbert, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
was flushed with conscious pride. A committee of
the city councils had the affair in charge, and they
made Mrs. Harkins, Herbert and Captain Janson
the guests of honor. The Mayor of the city made
the speech accepting the fountain, and then Captain
Janson, as the closest friend of David Harkins, was
called on for a few remarks.</p>

<p>The speech that he made that day was one of the
most remarkable that had ever been delivered in
the town. It told the story of the life of David Harkins,
and how he had once befriended the speaker
during what he firmly believed was the crisis of
his life. He then related in great detail how he
had come to Cleverly late that night and forced his
old friend to accept the ten $100 bills. Thus, without
making any direct reference to the ancient
rumors that had flourished in the town, the stain
attached to the memory of David Harkins was removed
in the most effective manner possible. John
Black and his daughter were present at the ceremonies,
and at the conclusion of the set speeches
Mr. Black arose and paid a fervent tribute to the
integrity of David Harkins. Altogether everything
was done in the most complete manner, and the affair
was a great success and a red letter day in the
history of Cleverly.</p>

<p>The story of the event was told in a full page report
in the current issue of the Banner. To the delight<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
of Mr. Brooks, Herbert had volunteered to
write the report, and it proved to be one of the best
pieces of reporting that had ever been done for the
local paper. Captain Janson was the hero of the
occasion. He remained in Cleverly for about a
week, and he spent his money so lavishly and with
such utter unconcern that he came to be looked upon
as a modern Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>During his stay he formed quite an intimacy with
Noah Brooks, and it was not very long before the
whole-hearted sailor and the eccentric editor were
almost indispensable to each other. Sitting in the
Banner office one day Janson said:</p>

<p>“See here, Brooks, Cleverly looks to me like a
good port in a storm. It strikes me that it would
be a pretty good place for an old worn out hulk like
Captain Janson. I’ve got a great notion to gather
my stores and anchor here for the rest of my life.”</p>

<p>Brooks thought so, too, and said he felt satisfied
that the Captain would never have cause to regret
making the change in his dwelling place. The
sight of the two old men sitting on the porch exchanging
stories of the varied experiences they had
undergone during their stormy lives was a picture
not to be forgotten very quickly. At least Herbert
Harkins thought so, and when he finally took the
train for his return to New York the pretty little
scene remained engraved upon his memory.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH A TELEPHONE CALL PRODUCES SOME UNEXPECTED RESULTS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert returned to New York from Cleverly
in the gayest of spirits. He was happier than he
had been for years, and was filled with a desire to
communicate this light-hearted feeling to everyone
that he met. The fact that the long standing cloud
had been removed from the memory of his father
made him forget his own troubles for the time at
least. A week before everything had appeared dark
and gloomy; but now the dawn had arrived and the
earth assumed a cheerful appearance. With the
light-heartedness of youth, he looked forward to a
future of prosperity and uninterrupted happiness.</p>

<p>The time was within a month of Christmas, and
before leaving Cleverly he had exacted a promise
from his mother that she would come to New York
on the eve of the festival and stay with him over
the holidays. He was already mentally planning
out the treat that would be given her on her arrival
in the metropolis. It was in this mood that he hurried
to his apartments. He found Tomlin at home,<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
and opening and closing the door boisterously,
shouted:</p>

<p>“Hello Tomlin, old fellow! I want you to jump
up and shake hands with a very happy man.”</p>

<p>Tomlin did jump up and did shake hands with
his friend; but he said nothing, gazing on the other
with an expectant air. Receiving no response to his
silent inquiry, he asked:</p>

<p>“Have you fallen heir to a fortune?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Herbert, “something better than
that.”</p>

<p>“Have you obtained a permanent position on one
of the big papers?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Herbert, and this time a little
sadly, “not that.”</p>

<p>“Well, what in the world is it?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“Simply this,” replied Herbert, speaking hurriedly
and with some feeling; “after a number of
anxious years I have succeeded in clearing the memory
of my father from a stain that has rested upon
it ever since his death.”</p>

<p>Very rapidly he sketched the events that had followed
one another from the time he had read the
little personal in the Herald until the unveiling of
the memorial fountain in Cleverly.</p>

<p>Tomlin whistled.</p>

<p>“This is news indeed, and I never knew a thing
about it. Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>“I owe you an apology for that,” said Herbert
contritely, “but I was a victim of circumstances.
After my interview with the old sea captain I missed
you, and found it necessary to go to Cleverly immediately.
Besides that I had a strong desire to
complete the whole business so that I might give
you the story in full when we met.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” said the other heartily, his
eyes glistening with the pleasure he felt. “Why the
thing has the flavor of a romance from real life.
Say, it would make a bully story for the Argus.”</p>

<p>Herbert raised his hand in protest.</p>

<p>“Don’t think of such a thing, Tomlin!” he exclaimed.
“I am not desirous of any publicity just
at this time. I wouldn’t have Blakeley even hear
my name or to see it, at least not for some time to
come. I know that he feels very bitterly towards
me, and I realize that he has a real justification for
that feeling. Some day I may be able to win back
his good opinion.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” fervently ejaculated Tomlin; then
as if the thought had just struck him: “Why not
make the attempt now?”</p>

<p>“It is not possible now,” said Herbert in a positive
tone, which conveyed a distinct desire to close
the subject.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Tomlin, “you will have to
get down to work. You’ve been wasting a lot of<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
your time when you should have been toiling for
your bread and butter. I’ve got an order here for
three specials, and you will have to turn them out
before the end of the week.”</p>

<p>“I’m your man,” responded Herbert enthusiastically.
Then looking at his friend fondly, he added:</p>

<p>“Say, Tomlin, how can I ever repay you for
your goodness to me?”</p>

<p>“By never speaking about it,” was the crisp reply.</p>

<p>Herbert started in immediately and began working
on the specials that had been ordered for the
following week. He had to go out for several days
and nights in succession in order to obtain the material,
but once that was in hand he worked quickly
and industriously. One of the articles was a graphic
description of the entrance to the Brooklyn bridge
at the rush hour in the evening. The subject was
not new by any means; but Herbert handled it with
such cleverness and originality that it made a very
readable page in the Sunday issue of one of the enterprising
newspapers. Another of the specials was
a description of Chinatown at night, couched in
such phraseology as to make the reader believe that
the scenes so graphically described were taking
place in the heart of one of the cities of old China
instead of actually being enacted in the midst of
the American metropolis. The third article gave<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
the impressions of a man who went to the very top
of one of the highest buildings on Manhattan Island
and viewed the surrounding country.</p>

<p>The Argus office was only a few blocks from the
lodgings of the two young men. While Herbert
was hard at work one night, Tomlin rushed in unexpectedly,
and said in agitated tones:</p>

<p>“I’ve got a sensational tip that I want you to
run out for me. I am tied up on another story now,
and there is no one in the office. It may be nothing,
or it may be a good thing; but if you are willing
to tackle it I will guarantee that you will not
lose anything by the operation.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about losses,” said Herbert impatiently;
“tell me what you want.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other; “I was around at the
precinct police station a little while ago. The telephone
bell rang while I was in the room. The
house sergeant was sound asleep, snoring like a
log, so I took the liberty of responding to the call.
When I got my ear to the receiver a very feminine
voice said:</p>

<p>“‘Is this the police station?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes ma’am,’ I replied, wondering what was
coming next.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the sweet voice again, ‘a burglar
has broken into our house and I have him locked in
the sitting room, and I will be very much obliged<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
indeed if you will send an officer here at once to
take the man into custody.’</p>

<p>“Just in the most matter of fact manner imaginable,”
cried Tomlin. “Could anything be more
picturesque or interesting? Here is a woman who
is not afraid of a burglar. She calmly telephones
for the police to come and arrest him. I think
that’s a peach of a story, and if you have any red
blood in your veins you will grab your hat and
coat and start off on the story before I am able to
say ten more words.”</p>

<p>This was precisely what Herbert did. In less
than a minute’s time he was at the door, and turning
to Tomlin, said:</p>

<p>“Where’s the house? What was the number?”</p>

<p>“The cabby knows all about it,” said Tomlin,
pointing to a stout man who was sitting on the
high seat of a cab in front of the door.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p>“That’s the cabby,” replied Tomlin; “you don’t
suppose I would come here without furnishing you
with all the conveniences necessary to do the job.
There’s a policeman in plain clothes on the inside
of the cab. All you have to do is to go with him,
help him to make the arrest, and then write up the
story. I’ll call here again in an hour and get the
copy. If it proves to be a beat, I’ll give it to Blakeley
in the morning and quietly let him know that<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
you have sent it in as a partial act of retribution
for the scurvy manner in which you treated him on
that other big scoop.”</p>

<p>“Tomlin, I wish you would stop talking about
that,” said Herbert impatiently; “but I’ll do the
best I can with this story.” And with a farewell
shout he jumped into the cab, pulled the door to
with a slam and was whirled in the direction of
upper New York. The cab driver had evidently
been given an extra fee for speed, because he lashed
his horse unmercifully, and the vehicle went whirling
up Broadway at a gait which terrified chance
pedestrians and aroused the ire of sleepy policemen.
Once the hub of the wheel struck another team
that was coming down-town, and for several seconds
Herbert felt that their team was about to be
wrecked; but by some lucky chance the wheels became
extricated and the cab once more resumed its
upward and onward journey. Finally, after many
minutes had passed, it turned off the main highway
into a side street. Herbert noticed by glancing at
a lamp on the side of the thoroughfare that they had
turned into West 69th street. Presently the cab
stopped, and when Herbert and the officer had
alighted, the cabby, pointing towards a brownstone
house with the tip of his whip, said:</p>

<p>“That’s your house, boys.”</p>

<p>Herbert looked up at the dwelling, and something<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
familiar about it arrested his attention. He looked
again to make sure, but there could be no doubt
about it.</p>

<p>It was the home of John Black. Herbert stood
on the sidewalk for some seconds, half dazed at
this entirely unexpected discovery. He wondered
curiously what fatality it was that had brought him
to this house on such a strange errand at such an
hour of the night; but presently he aroused himself.
Speculation was in vain; action was necessary.
After a few whispered instructions to the officer, he
walked up the high steps and rang the bell.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">PROVING THAT BAD PERSONS, LIKE BAD PENNIES, ARE CONSTANTLY REAPPEARING</span></h2>
</div>


<p>After ringing the bell of the house, Herbert
waited for a long time, but there was no response.
Instantly his whole being was thrown into a fever
of impatience and unrest. He imagined all sorts of
terrible things. His mind was filled with terror.
What if he had arrived on the scene too late?
What if some crime had been committed in the dead
of the night? Curiously enough, during that mental
review he never thought of John Black or his wife.
The one person constantly in his mind was Mary
Black.</p>

<p>He rang the bell a second time. This time it was
done fiercely, angrily. He listened eagerly, but received
no immediate response, and then consulted
with the policeman upon the advisability of going
to the rear of the house and breaking in. While
they were talking a sound was heard at the parlor
window, and the next moment it was thrown open.
A head was pushed cautiously out of the window.
Herbert recognized it at a glance. It was Mary<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
Black. He was on the top step now, and leaning
over, said quietly so as not to alarm the girl:</p>

<p>“Mary.”</p>

<p>She started at the sound of a familiar voice, and
peering out into the gloom, exclaimed in genuine
surprise:</p>

<p>“Herbert Harkins!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mary,” he answered; “what is the difficulty?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m terribly frightened,” she cried, “someone
has broken into the house. I don’t know who
it is, except that it is a man. I was reading in my
room when I heard a grating sound at the kitchen
door. Presently it was opened, and footsteps could
be heard going into the dining room. Then all
was silent for awhile. I came down the front stairway
about half way, and leaning over the banister,
looked in the dining room. The fellow’s back was
to me. He was seated at the table calmly eating
some cold meat that he had taken out of the refrigerator.
He had a couple of bottles of papa’s
wine, also, and was drinking that with great relish.
Scarcely knowing what to do, I crept back to my
room. Both papa and mamma had gone out for the
evening, and I had no idea when they would return
home. While I was in my room, in an agony of
fear, I heard the fellow come upstairs. He went
back into the library, and securing a large tablecloth,<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
filled it with the silverware and other valuable
things that he had carried from the dining room.
Then he sank back into a large arm chair and calmly
went to sleep. It was then that I conceived the
idea of sounding the alarm. I pulled the doors of
the library to and locking them securely, came down
to the hall, where we have a telephone, and notified
the police.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Herbert at the conclusion of
this narrative, “you have acted very discreetly. Is
the fellow still asleep?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied; “he evidently awakened a
few minutes ago, because I hear him in the room.
He has discovered the fact that he is a prisoner,
and I am sure will either jump through one of the
back windows or break open the door.”</p>

<p>Herbert immediately sent the policeman to the
rear of the house, with instructions to arrest anybody
who might attempt to escape from that part
of the property. Another patrolman fortunately
passing by at this time, volunteered to guard the
front of the house, while Herbert went in to grapple
with the intruder.</p>

<p>Mary was quite solicitous for Herbert’s safety,
as was only natural.</p>

<p>“Please be careful,” she said; “he may be a dangerous
character. Don’t you think you had better
send one of the officers up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>“No,” said Herbert, “I think I’ll tackle this job
myself.”</p>

<p>He felt some apprehension, but being a man, did
not propose to display it before a girl for whom
he had so much regard as Mary Black.</p>

<p>He crept up the stairs silently, armed with a pistol
which Tomlin had thoughtfully provided. He
heard a great knocking on the doors of the library,
and going there immediately, turned the key and
threw them open. The man within, surprised at
this bold movement, retreated to the rear of the
room. There was no light, but Herbert could see
his figure dimly moving in the gloom.</p>

<p>“Surrender or you will be shot!” he shouted
sternly.</p>

<p>For answer the burglar drew a pistol from his
pocket, and aiming at Herbert, pulled the trigger.
There was a flash of light and then all was silence.
Herbert felt a tickling sensation like a pin prick
on the back of his right hand. He lifted it, and
noticed that the bullet had just grazed the top of
his hand, which was already bleeding. Smarting
with anger, he raised his own pistol and fired. It
went far of the mark, but it produced results, for
a heavy bass voice coming out of the darkness
shouted:</p>

<p>“Stop shooting, and I’ll surrender.”</p>

<p>Herbert put his pistol away, and striking a match,<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
lit the gas. The burglar was crouching in a corner
of the room back of a book-case. His clothing
seemed to be in tatters. Herbert strode over to
where he was and grabbing him by the arm, pulled
him out. The man turned round with a whine:</p>

<p>“You’re not going to hurt me, are you?” he said.</p>

<p>Something in the voice attracted Herbert at once.
He scrutinized the bleared face and recognized in
it the countenance of Harry Adler. The discovery
aroused his indignation.</p>

<p>“You scoundrel!” he shouted, raising his voice
in his anger. “What do you mean by coming here
and trying to rob these people. Aren’t you satisfied
with the injury you have already done to this family?
You have taken their boy away from them,
and now to cap the climax, you are low enough and
despicable enough to come and try to rob them of
their property.”</p>

<p>“What family?” asked Adler, looking up at the
young man with a sullen gaze.</p>

<p>“What family?” ejaculated Herbert, “do you
mean to say that you did not know that this was
John Black’s house?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply with an ugly leer. “I didn’t
know it was John Black’s house. I was hard up;
I had to get something; I needed money. This
looked like an easy thing. How could I tell whose
crib I was trying to crack?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Herbert bitterly, “you put your
head in the noose this time all right You’ve been
caught red-handed, and you’ll go to jail without
doubt.”</p>

<p>“How do you know this?” asked Adler, with
sudden defiance.</p>

<p>“Because the house is guarded back and front,”
was the reply; “because I have caught you in the
act and you are my prisoner now, and I don’t propose
to permit you to escape.”</p>

<p>The burglar looked at his antagonist in a blank
sort of way for a moment, then a glitter of intelligence
and cunning suddenly illumined the fishy eyes
and the sodden face.</p>

<p>“If you permit the police to take me up to-night
you’ll regret it to the very end of your life.”</p>

<p>Something in the man’s manner and in the tone
of his voice arrested Herbert’s attention. Some instinctive
feeling seemed to tell him that these words
were not mere bravado. He turned to the culprit:</p>

<p>“Why? Why do you say this?”</p>

<p>“Because,” exclaimed Adler, in a shrill voice,
“if you have me arrested I’ll squeal. I’ll tell the
truth and the whole truth about young Arthur
Black. He came to New York with me as my
partner. He was concerned in that dirty get-rich-quick
business. I’ll turn State’s evidence, and if
I go to jail he’ll go with me, and you can bet your<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
sweet life that the Black family will be mighty unhappy
before I get through with them.”</p>

<p>Herbert was the picture of distress. The man
watched him with a leer. With all his defects,
Adler possessed acute intelligence and he realized
that Herbert was more deeply interested in Mary
Black than he was willing to acknowledge. Knowing
this, he felt that he had struck his captor in
his weakest spot. It did not take Herbert long to
decide. Turning to the unfortunate man, he said:</p>

<p>“Suppose you are released, what then?”</p>

<p>“Then mum’s the word,” replied the burglar,
“I’ll not squeal; I’ll go about my business and let
you and your friends go about yours.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” was Herbert’s comment. Going
to the foot of the stairs, he called for Mary
Black. She came up very much agitated. She
peeped in at the burglar, who still lay in a heap on
the floor, and shuddered at the sight. Herbert
whispered to her.</p>

<p>“Mary, this man deserves to be arrested and imprisoned;
but I have a great notion to let him go.
He is an old Cleverly boy. It’s Harry Adler. He
never did amount to much, but it might be an act of
charity to permit him to go in peace this time.”</p>

<p>Her eyes brightened and the color returned to
her face. In her enthusiasm she took Herbert by
both hands, exclaiming:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>“I agree with you thoroughly, and I think you’re
simply great to act so generously with a man who
is at your mercy.”</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on the policemen
who had been patiently waiting in the front
and rear of the house, tiring of their long watch,
came inside and walked up the stairway. As they
joined the group, Herbert turned to the man who
had accompanied him, and said:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, this is all a deplorable error. This
gentleman is a distant relative of the family. In
the confusion he was taken for an intruder. The
family is very much mortified, and hopes that nothing
more will be said about the matter.”</p>

<p>The policemen smiled at this and bowing their
heads in acquiescence left the house, chuckling in
audible tones. Such scenes were not unfamiliar to
the members of the metropolitan police force. As
soon as they had gotten out of sight, Herbert turned
to Adler, and in a tone freighted with anger and
contempt, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Go!”</p>

<p>The man looked up out of the corner of his eye
as if to assure himself that there was no treachery
intended, and then slunk downstairs and out into the
street.</p>

<p>As he withdrew Mary turned to Herbert and
then suddenly gave a terrible scream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, Mary?” he cried anxiously,
rushing over to her.</p>

<p>“Oh that, that!” she exclaimed, pointing to his
right hand, which was now almost covered with
blood; “you have been shot. You are wounded.”</p>

<p>Herbert, who had forgotten his slight injury,
looked down at his discolored hand and gave a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing,” he cried; “if you will get
me a little hot water and a bandage, I think we can
straighten that out in short order.”</p>

<p>She proceeded to do this, bustling about with
much intelligence and vivacity. The wound was
dressed and she was in the act of binding it up when
Mr. and Mrs. Black returned. They were amazed
to see Herbert Harkins there, and still more thunderstruck
when they learned the story of the attempted
robbery. John Black was grateful, but he
shook his head as he said to Herbert:</p>

<p>“You should not have released the man. He
is a menace to society, and may attempt the same
crime against other citizens.”</p>

<p>Mary spoke up at this point, saying:</p>

<p>“I disagree with you, father. Herbert was right.
He might have been mistaken, but he was merciful
and that after all means much in this unfeeling
world.”</p>

<p>Herbert was delighted at such praise, and bidding<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
her good-night stooped down and kissed her hand
in the chivalrous manner of a gentleman of the old
school.</p>

<p>The act appeared to please the girl, for her face
crimsoned and stooping down, she picked up his
wounded hand and gave it a kiss.</p>

<p>“You deserve it,” she said impulsively, “because
you have acted the part of a hero.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH A BAD MAN REACHES THE END OF HIS ROPE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert walked home from the Black residence
that night. He did not care to ride. He wanted
to have the opportunity to think over the exciting
incidents of the last hour, and felt that he could not
do so with any satisfaction to himself unless he was
alone. The clocks were striking one o’clock in the
morning when he finally reached his lodgings. The
gas was burning in the little sitting room, and Tomlin
was there in an attitude of expectancy.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said, with a questioning look.
“What was the result of your adventure?”</p>

<p>Herbert’s jaw fell. It suddenly dawned upon
him that he was once more placed in the attitude of
a delinquent. He had unconsciously forgotten all
about Tomlin and the fact that he was supposed to
be out on an assignment. The thought mortified
him very much. He looked into Tomlin’s clear
eyes, and what he saw there prompted him to be
candid. There was no use in attempting to beat
about the bush; he would tell the truth and tell it as<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
simply as possible; so he sat down and related all
that had occurred from the time he left Tomlin early
in the evening until the present moment. Only
upon one phase of the story did he attempt any disguise,
and that was when he related the threat which
had been hurled at him by the burglar. He told
his friend that a person who was very dear to Mary
Black was in Adler’s power, and that the robber
had threatened to expose this person and involve
him in disgrace if he was not given an immediate release.
When Herbert had concluded his narrative,
Tomlin leaned back in his chair and gave vent to a
hearty laugh. Herbert could not understand the
cause of his mirth, and said so. Tomlin laughed
again, and then said:</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you see the humorous side of
this thing; but it appeals to me very strongly. See
here, Harkins, this thing is becoming marked with
you. It begins to look as if you had gotten into
the habit of falling down on all of your assignments.”</p>

<p>“I do feel a bit silly about this,” began Herbert,
“but you see the position I was placed in. You
see it was this way&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No explanations are necessary,” interrupted
Tomlin in his familiar, hearty tones, “explanations
are not of much use anyhow. Your friends don’t
expect them, and your enemies wouldn’t believe<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
them. I’m frank to say, however, that you did just
what any man with red blood in his veins would
have done under the circumstances. In fact I would
have acted just as you did.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t feel badly over it? You don’t
blame me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” interrupted his friend once more;
“I only ask you to promise me that you are through
with this chivalrous business, and that if you intend
to stay in the newspaper profession, you will quit
it right here and now, and that hereafter when
you are sent out on an assignment you will cover it
and write it like a sensible man. Do you promise,
Herbert?”</p>

<p>“I promise,” said the other meekly.</p>

<p>Thus ended the episode of the attempted robbery.
Two days later Herbert started out early in the
morning in order to make a tour of the hospitals
for the purpose of finding some material for special
articles. The first institution he visited was the
Samaritan Hospital, with whose superintendent he
was on terms of intimacy.</p>

<p>“Got anything to-day?” he said to that official.</p>

<p>“Not much,” was the yawning reply, “at least
not much out of the ordinary. I don’t think we’ve
anything here that you would care for.”</p>

<p>“Any deaths to-day?”</p>

<p>“No; but we have a queer sort of fellow here<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
who was shot last night while trying to break into
a house up-town.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” remarked Herbert carelessly. “I
don’t suppose there’s anything unusual in the case?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so,” was the rejoinder.
“Here’s his name,” and the superintendent pushed
the big register over in the direction of Herbert.</p>

<p>The young man looked at the open page carelessly,
and then gave a sudden start.</p>

<p>The name on the book was decidedly familiar.
It was that of Harry Adler. Instantly he became
all attention.</p>

<p>“Was the man seriously injured?” he asked anxiously,
turning to the superintendent.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he was; he was shot in the groin
while attempting to escape from the house.”</p>

<p>“How is he getting along?”</p>

<p>“Badly,” was the response; “in fact I am satisfied
in my own mind that he is going to make a die of
it.”</p>

<p>Herbert’s sympathies were instantly aroused. He
had no regard whatever for Adler, and looked upon
him as a very undesirable member of society; but
the thought of any man being shot and dying from
his wounds appealed strongly to his sympathetic nature.</p>

<p>“I used to know this man at one time,” he said;
“I wonder if I could be of any use to him. I wonder<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
if he has any friends or relatives that he would
care to see.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Could I see him?” persisted Herbert eagerly;
“I might be able to do something.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the ready rejoinder, “come with
me.”</p>

<p>The two men walked up a flight of stairs and
into the accident ward of the hospital. They passed
along through row after row of white counterpaned
cots. Men of all kinds and descriptions were on
these beds of suffering; some within the shadow
of the Valley of Death, and others convalescent. In
the last cot on the very end row they found the
wounded burglar. He presented a pitiable spectacle;
and when Herbert looked at his white face
and at the countenance twisted with suffering, his
heart melted and he forgot all the evil the man had
done during his useless life. He groaned with the
pain and looked up just as they reached his bedside.
His eyes flashed a glance of recognition at Herbert.
He put a thin hand outside of the coverlet, and exclaimed
eagerly, but in a weak and husky voice:</p>

<p>“Hello there, boy! You’re just the person I
want to see.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Herbert, stooping down and
speaking in a gentle voice.</p>

<p>“It’s just this,” replied the other in a voice that<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
was not more than audible; “I am satisfied that I’ve
reached the end of my rope. The doctor says
there’s no hope for me. I suppose it serves me
right, but that don’t make me feel any better. I
know I’ve led a very miserable existence, and I suppose
that as a man lives so he must die. It’s too
late for me to do any good in the world now; but
while I have the strength and the voice I’d like to
clear up one little thing in which I am satisfied you
have a personal interest.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” assented Herbert with much eagerness,
bending a little lower so that he might hear the
man’s voice; “what is it about?”</p>

<p>“It’s about the robbery of John Black’s house in
Cleverly.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” exclaimed Herbert, his eyes
sparkling with the excitement of the moment;
“what is it you want to tell me?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other, “you know all about the
rumors that flew around Cleverly at that time.
Your father’s name was involved. I want to tell
you, and it’s a dying man who is speaking to you,
that he was innocent of that.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” replied Herbert; “but who was
guilty?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you that very briefly,” answered the
stricken man. “You know the kind of fellow I
was. I had no scruples. I wanted to live without<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
work. I got acquainted with young Arthur Black,
and I am afraid that I was the means of corrupting
his morals. I traveled with him a great deal, and
he learned many vicious habits through me. Well,
this went on for some time, and one day I was filled
with the desire of getting a good stake and running
off to New York. In the course of my acquaintance
with Arthur Black I learned that his father sometimes
brought home money from the bank. On this
particular day a customer who came in from the
country late in the afternoon was anxious to make
a deposit. It was after business hours, and the
safe had been closed and locked for the day. The
cashier, who was charged with the care of the vault,
had gone home and could not be reached. To accommodate
the depositor, Mr. Black accepted his
money and took it home with him that night. I
was hanging around the door of the bank at this
time and overheard the conversation between the
two men. I was tempted. It isn’t necessary to say
that it did not take much to tempt me; but I was
filled with an unquenchable desire to get hold of
that money.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the wounded man, his voice
becoming lower and lower, “I hunted up Arthur immediately
and managed to spend the next two hours
with him. I pumped him about the habits of his
father and the routine of their household. I wanted<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
to know particularly how he was able to get in the
house when he left me late at night as he often did.
He said, in his innocence, that his mother was always
his friend, and that in spite of the anger of his
father she persisted in taking care of him. One of
the ways she employed to do this was to leave the
key of the dead latch of the door under the mat
which lay on the front porch. That was the very
thing I was anxious to learn, and when I discovered
it I left Arthur abruptly, saying that I would see
him the next night. It was after midnight when
I went around to the Black house. The inmates
apparently were asleep. I hung around till nearly
one o’clock in the morning, anxious that all the
conditions should be ripe for my dishonest enterprise.
When I lifted the mat I found the key there
as it had been described to me by Arthur Black.
I got into the house without difficulty and went to
the old man’s desk. It was one of those frail roll-top
affairs, and I succeeded in breaking into it without
any difficulty. I took the money, and then to
throw them off the scent, broke the bolt on the back
door to convey the impression that the robber had
entered in that manner.”</p>

<p>“What happened then?” asked Herbert eagerly.</p>

<p>“The rest is soon told,” said Adler, his voice
sinking to the merest whisper; “I became aware of
the excitement that had been created by the robbery<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
and kept myself in seclusion for some days. I felt
a little bad when I learned that an effort had been
made to place the robbery on your father, and when
he died I was almost on the verge of making a confession;
but didn’t do it. Some days after this I
decided to go to New York with the money, and
in a fit of devilishness resolved to take Arthur Black
to New York with me. It seemed to me a very
clever trick to entertain this foolish boy with the
money that I had stolen from his father. You know
the rest. We came here and he went from bad to
worse until we got into that get-rich-quick concern
which led to the breaking up of our partnership.
Something happened to him then. What it was I
have never discovered; but the boy turned good, and
left me, saying that our paths would lie in different
directions in the future; and he has kept his word
from that day to this. You remember what happened
the other night when you had me cornered
in old Black’s house. I used Arthur’s name to secure
my own liberty. There you have the whole
story. I’m sorry for what I’ve done; that’s all I
can say.”</p>

<p>The importance of this confession was appreciated
by Herbert, who through the assistance of the
superintendent, hastily summoned a stenographer
and a Notary Public. Although the effort was a
very painful one, Adler repeated his story just as<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
he had told it to Herbert. After it had been reduced
to writing, he swore to the truth of it, and
then having a pen placed within his trembling
fingers, signed his name in scrawling lines.</p>

<p>Herbert asked the man if there was anything he
could do for him. He said if it was possible to
lighten his last hours in any way he would be only
too glad to do it; but Adler shook his head in a
melancholy way and said he had no request to make.
Herbert wanted to know if he had relatives or
friends he wished to see before his death. Once
more he shook his head, and added:</p>

<p>“My mother died when I was only a few years
old; my father never took care of me. I don’t
know now whether he is dead or alive, and even if
I was aware of his abiding place I would not ask
him to come here.”</p>

<p>Herbert felt a strange lump coming into his throat
at these words. He wondered with a queer feeling
about his heart whether he would have been any
better than this dying man if his early life and surroundings
had been the same; but when he left the
hospital it was with a feeling of elation over the
strange manner in which every detail of the Cleverly
mystery had been brought to light. The vindication
of his father’s memory was absolutely complete,
and he could now go out into the world with a firm
step and with his head in the air. On his return<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
to his room he told the whole story to Tomlin, who
listened with absorbed attention. Late that afternoon
he made another call at the Samaritan Hospital.
The superintendent, who was in the office,
gave him a nod of recognition.</p>

<p>“How is that wounded man?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p>“Dead,” was the terse reply.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">WHEREIN THE CLOUDS PASS AWAY AND THE SUN SHINES ON HERBERT HARKINS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Herbert Harkins voluntarily assumed the care
and disposal of the remains of the unfortunate
criminal. The young reporter was acquainted with
the Coroner’s undertaker and through his assistance
and that of some mutual friends he was able to secure
a cheap lot in an out of town cemetery. The
obsequies of the departed one were pathetic in the
extreme. The only two mourners at the funeral&mdash;if
they could be called mourners&mdash;were Herbert
Harkins and Francis Tomlin. The whole affair
was tinged with an atmosphere that was at once
sombre and desolate; but at all events Adler had
been given a Christian burial, and that was the thing
that Herbert desired most of all.</p>

<p>“You’re a curious fellow, Harkins,” said Tomlin
to the young man on their way home from the
cemetery.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p>“Why, by your actions,” was the reply; “you
are constantly doing unexplainable things. Take<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
to-day for instance. Who else would have done so
much for a man who was the cause of all his
troubles?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Herbert, “but you must understand
that my troubles are now buried in the grave with
that poor, miserable man. I can afford to be generous.”</p>

<p>“Even if you are not just?”</p>

<p>“Who shall determine that&mdash;I for one shall
always shrink from being the judge of my fellow
men.”</p>

<p>“But you know that this Adler was thoroughly
disreputable&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Herbert, “and that is all the
more reason why I should be reputable. A man
must be merciful if he looks for mercy himself.”</p>

<p>They had reached their rooms by this time, and
after a few preliminaries, Herbert sat down at his
desk and began to clear up an accumulation of work
that had been neglected during the past week, largely
because his time was taken up in preparing for the
funeral arrangements of Harry Adler. This work
occupied his attention almost constantly till late in
the night. His last act was to write a letter to his
mother at Cleverly, reminding her that she would
be expected to arrive in New York on Christmas
Eve, which important occasion would occur on the
following day. He put a special delivery stamp on<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
the letter and carried it around to one of the sub-post
office stations in order to insure its prompt
delivery on the following morning.</p>

<p>When the day before Christmas arrived it brought
with it a fine fall of snow, and quite early in the
morning the face of New York was hidden from
view with a soft, fleecy covering. At noon time
that day Herbert received a telegram from his
mother saying that she would be unable to reach
New York till about eleven o’clock on Christmas
morning. It seemed odd that she should disappoint
him in this unaccountable way; but he thrust the
telegram in his pocket, and in the rush of his everyday
duties quickly forgot the incident.</p>

<p>That evening Tomlin came into the house with a
rather solemn face and said to Herbert:</p>

<p>“I have been made the bearer of a message to
you. Mr. Blakeley says that he would like to see
you at the Argus office at nine o’clock this evening.”</p>

<p>Herbert’s face flushed at this unexpected announcement.
It was the first time that he had
heard from Blakeley either directly or indirectly,
since the dramatic incident which terminated his
career on the newspaper. At first the message filled
him with a sense of elation; but this was quickly
followed by a feeling of resentment. His face
hardened, and he said with much dignity:</p>

<p>“If Mr. Blakeley desires to communicate with<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
me, or to call upon me, he knows my address. I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now see here,” quickly interrupted Tomlin,
“I don’t want any of this nonsense from you. I
don’t care what you do or what you say to Blakeley;
but I don’t propose to have you make me look silly
and ridiculous.”</p>

<p>Herbert melted in a minute. The distress and
annoyance in his friend’s face changed his whole
manner.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t offend you for a moment, Tomlin,”
he said; “you have been such a good friend to me
that there isn’t anything in the world that I would
not do to serve you. I had felt a bit angry towards
Blakeley, but I could not hold anything but the
kindest feelings toward you. If you say go, I’ll
go in a minute.”</p>

<p>Tomlin’s answer was clear, crisp and to the point.
He simply said in his loudest voice:</p>

<p>“Go!”</p>

<p>At nine o’clock that evening Herbert found himself
ascending the stairway toward the local room
of the Argus. When he entered, a number of the
men were busily engaged at their desks; but they
all looked up and gave him a cheery greeting. The
old familiar scenes coming upon him unexpectedly
seemed to rush through his memory like floods of
water surging over a falls. Blakeley, as usual, occupied
his desk in the corner of the room. He<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
looked quite lifelike to Herbert as he sat there
puffing a strong cigar, with his feet cocked up on
the edge of his desk, reading a proof that had just
been rushed down from the composing room.</p>

<p>The moment he perceived Herbert he moved his
feet from the desk, arose from his chair, and extending
his hand, said with considerable cordiality:</p>

<p>“Hello, Harkins, I’m glad to see you again.”</p>

<p>Herbert took the proffered hand, but held it somewhat
limply. He could not enthuse on such short
notice. Presently he was invited to take a seat, and
did so. Tomlin, without being asked, also sat down
to listen to the conversation.</p>

<p>“I was quite sorry to lose you, Harkins,” said
Blakeley after an interval.</p>

<p>Herbert looked in his face for a moment to see
whether he was jesting. Such an admission from
such a man was very unusual; but Blakeley looked
him squarely in the eye, and there was neither mirth
nor sarcasm in the glance, so he answered softly:</p>

<p>“I was sorry to go, Mr. Blakeley.”</p>

<p>“But,” exclaimed the city editor, and the quiet
eye now flashed fire, “you treated me very meanly.
I must say that, and I am going to repeat it, you
treated me very meanly.”</p>

<p>“I admit that I did,” said Herbert, his tone
softer than before; “but I was the victim of circumstances
over which I had no control.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>Blakeley puffed at his cigar for awhile after that,
and then as if he was giving voice to a long cherished
desire, said:</p>

<p>“Now see here, Harkins, I want to put a plain
question to you. Why did you refuse to write that
story&mdash;now tell me as plainly as you can, and all
will be square between us.”</p>

<p>Herbert arose before the city editor had finished
making his request. The look of annoyance in his
face gave way to indignation, and then he said with
considerable heat:</p>

<p>“Is that all you have to say to me, Mr. Blakeley?”
and receiving no answer, he went on, “If it
is, I will leave you. There is no need of any further
conversation between us.”</p>

<p>At this point Blakeley arose with a smile on his
face that seemed to stretch almost from ear to ear.
His eyes were sparkling with good nature, and going
over to Herbert he took his hand and wrung
it heartily.</p>

<p>“You are all right, my boy; you are pure gold.
I don’t propose to let you get out of here again.
I need you in my business.”</p>

<p>Herbert was plainly puzzled at this demonstration,
and said so at once.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you should be so pleased, Mr.
Blakeley. I have declined to answer your query.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” he said; “it demonstrates what<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
I have always believed, that you wouldn’t betray a
confidence. However a kind friend has already
done that for you.”</p>

<p>Herbert’s eyes expressed the surprise he felt.
Before he could make any reply a door in the rear
of Mr. Blakeley’s office opened suddenly, and Arthur
Black appeared upon the scene. Herbert
gasped for breath. He was too much amazed to
speak to the young man. Blakeley spared him that
trouble by saying:</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Black, we are all together; tell me
once again the story that you were good enough to
relate to me early in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“The story is soon told,” said Arthur, with a
firmness in his voice and a dignity in his manner
that Herbert had never noticed before; “I come here
to do a tardy act of justice to one of the manliest
persons I have ever known. Mr. Blakeley, as I
have already told you, I was foolish enough and
despicable enough to engage in, or rather to permit
myself to be used in a swindling game that was being
conducted in this city some time ago. Herbert
Harkins ran that story out for the Argus and was
prepared to make an arrest of one of those who
were engaged in the game; but when he discovered
that I was implicated in it he permitted me to escape,
and as a result of that act of generosity, lost
a good story and forfeited his position on the Argus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[222]</span></p>

<p>“I left the city immediately after that incident
occurred,” continued Arthur, “and went to a little
town in Connecticut, where I endeavored to make
a new man of myself. I think I have partially succeeded.
I am not going to stop till I succeed entirely;
but only a week ago I learned of the misfortune
which had happened to Herbert Harkins
through his effort to shield me and my family from
disgrace. I have not been able to rest at night
since I learned this news. Finally I could stand it
no longer, and I came here to tell you the truth and
the simple truth. Herbert did throw the Argus
down on its good story, but he did so for my sake
and the sake of my father and mother and sister.
I am here now not only to admit this, but to throw
myself on your mercy. If you think the ends of
justice have not already been served, I am willing to
submit to arrest and imprisonment. The punishment
will be a severe one, but probably not more
than I deserve. In any event I hope to restore
Herbert Harkins to your esteem, if not to the position
he formerly occupied on this paper.”</p>

<p>Herbert listened to this recital in open mouthed
wonder. He watched Arthur Black keenly while
he was telling his story, and as he proceeded, was
filled with admiration for the young man. He could
see very clearly now that Arthur was not really a
bad boy at heart; that he had been a spoiled child<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
in his youth and had drifted into the company of
dissolute young men. What at first was merely
waywardness had gradually extended to more serious
things; but fortunately his downward career
had been checked just on the edge of a precipice.</p>

<p>There was silence in the group for a few moments,
and then Blakeley spoke up in his short,
snappy tones. He took Arthur by the hand, and
said:</p>

<p>“I want to congratulate you, young man. You
have shown a manliness that does you credit. Now,
there is no paper in town that is more eager to obtain
exclusive news than the Argus, and I am willing
to admit that there are times when we feel disposed
to turn sharp corners in order to beat the other
newspapers; but we have the line of decency even
in this office, and I propose to draw it on this occasion.
You can rest at your ease. So far as I am
concerned and so far as the paper is concerned, the
firm with which you were connected never existed;
the incident at the post office never happened. I
can only say that you have my best wishes for your
future success in life.”</p>

<p>Everybody was delighted at this evidence of a
warm heart on the part of the man who had the
reputation of being a cold-blooded hunter for news.
But he was not through. He turned to Herbert
after a few moments of meditation, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></p>

<p>“Harkins, your old place awaits you on the Argus.
I want to tell you, as I have already told
young Black, that my memory is a blank, that you
have never offended me and that you have never
thrown the paper down. Your place has never been
filled. Your chair over at that desk is still vacant.
Come in again on Monday morning and try to distinguish
yourself.”</p>

<p>The manner of this man, no less than the words,
impressed Herbert deeply, and he mentally vowed
that he would do his duty by Blakeley and the Argus
to the full extent of his ability.</p>

<p>There was much laughter and much hand shaking
as the little party dispersed. Tomlin lingered a
little longer than the others, and when they were
out of ear-shot, said to Blakeley in quick tones:</p>

<p>“Say, old man, that was a cruel test with which
you began this session&mdash;that attempt to get Herbert
to squeal on Arthur Black.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” responded the other heartily, “it was indeed,
but it was the crucial test. It was worth all
the pain that it cost. It is proof positive to my
mind that Harkins can be trusted absolutely. He
would die before he violated a confidence. That’s
the kind of men we need on the Argus.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">DEMONSTRATING THE TRUTH OF THE SAYING THAT ALL’S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Christmas morning dawned cold and clear and
crisp with a nipping eagerness in the atmosphere
that brought the roses to the cheeks and warmed the
hearts of the multitudes who made their abode on
Manhattan Island. The spirit of the day seemed
to take hold of everybody and manifested itself in
the homes of the lowly as well as in those of the
great. Herbert attended early morning Mass, and
as he knelt before the crib of the Infant Saviour of
the world, his heart swelled with a feeling of profound
gratefulness for all the graces and favors that
had been showered upon him. Nowhere did the
meaning of the day seem more apparent than in the
little apartment which had been occupied so long
by Herbert Harkins and his friend Tomlin.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock that morning Tomlin turned to
Herbert and said:</p>

<p>“See here, old man, if you don’t hurry to the railroad
station you are likely to miss your mother.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with you, Tomlin?<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
You’re as nervous and fidgety as an old cat. The
train doesn’t come in for an hour yet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know,” said Tomlin in hurried tones.
“But you can’t depend on these New York trains.
They’re always ahead of time. Suppose your
mother got in and was waiting there now.”</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed the other, with a skeptical
look in his face, “I thought the trains were generally
behind time.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” responded the other in his nervous,
jerky way. “Ahead of time; ahead of time, always!
But see here, don’t you stand there trying
to get into an argument with me. You go and
fetch your mother. She has never been in New
York. Suppose she should start to come here herself
and get lost&mdash;and lost on Christmas morning,
too. Why, the idea is too terrible to contemplate.”</p>

<p>Herbert departed in a few minutes, much to the
satisfaction of his friend. The understanding was
that he should bring his mother to their little abode,
and then after the arrangement of some preliminaries,
that the three should go to a well known
restaurant for their holiday dinner. The moment
Herbert disappeared, however, there were strange
doings in that neighborhood. Tomlin stepped to
the front door and gave a low whistle. Immediately
two men stepped from within the shadows of
friendly doorways and joined him. One was Horace<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
Coke and the other Noah Brooks, who had
hurried up from Cleverly in order to join in the
conspiracy that had been laid by Francis Tomlin.</p>

<p>“Now, boys!” shouted the youth to the two
elderly men; “get down to work as soon as you
can.”</p>

<p>And they did. A bag filled with holly and evergreen
appeared as if by magic. Each of them
grabbed a handful, and in an incredibly short space
of time the doorways and windows and the gas
fixtures were artistically draped. After this the
little extension table was drawn out and filled with
all the additional leaves that it would hold. Then
a long tablecloth that had been engaged for the
occasion was thrown over the table. It was as
white and as pure as the driven snow, and even
without any food was an incentive to good cheer.
In the meantime a boy from a neighboring store
appeared with eight or ten additional chairs, carrying
them one at a time into the little apartment.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a tight squeeze,” said Tomlin,
“but I think we’ll make it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” exclaimed Brooks, “it’s going to be
tight all right; but the more the merrier is always
my motto.”</p>

<p>While the three conspirators were talking, John
Black and his wife and Mary Black appeared as if
by appointment. Mary insisted upon joining in the<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
housework, and her deft little fingers rapidly completed
the details that had not already been attended
to. John Anderson, the school teacher, who had
placed Herbert on the path which led to ultimate
success, dropped in a little later, and to cap the
climax, who should hove into view but Captain
Thomas Janson, bluff and hearty and loud-mouthed
as ever. He sailed into the room like a whiff of
salt air, and his mere presence was refreshing and
invigorating. He was handsomely attired for the
occasion. He had discarded his ordinary clothing,
and wore a handsome blue suit, with brass buttons
and gilt stripes on the sleeves, giving him, as one
of the other guests slyly remarked, the appearance
of a Rear Admiral of the United States Navy. A
nautical cap sat jauntily on the Captain’s shock of
bushy red hair. He puffed like a porpoise, for he
was quite stout now and beginning to feel the effects
of age. When he had finally settled himself comfortably
in a large chair which had been placed
for him at the head of the table, he turned around
to the others and cried out in his loudest voice:</p>

<p>“Does the boy know which way the wind
blows?”</p>

<p>“No!” came a chorus in reply.</p>

<p>“Good!” he exclaimed; “then it will fall to the
lot of old Captain Janson to tell him something
about the voyage of life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[229]</span></p>

<p>Tomlin looked at his watch at this period. It
pointed to high noon. He turned to the Captain:</p>

<p>“Herbert will be here in fifteen or twenty
minutes. I guess we had better start. What do
you say?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” snorted the old salt.</p>

<p>Without waiting for any further remarks, Tomlin
charged out of the front door, and in a few
minutes returned, followed by two white aproned
and white capped fellows, carrying waiters which
contained plates filled with eatables that were smoking
hot. When the covers were removed the air
was impregnated with an appetizing odor. The
two mates, as the Captain insisted upon calling the
two waiters, made five or six trips before they
finally completed their work to their satisfaction
and declared everything all right.</p>

<p>And indeed it was all right. The table presented
a beautiful sight, charming to the eye and tempting
to the palate. An enormous turkey, browned
to a crisp, occupied the center of the table; mounds
of mashed white potatoes and roasted sweet potatoes,
and dishes of cranberries moulded into the
most incomprehensible shapes&mdash;all looked so clean
and sweet that they must have tempted the most
jaded appetite. A row of mince pies flanked on
either side by delicious looking pumpkin pies, suggested
that the diners were expected to do some<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
very serious work before their day’s labor was
finished.</p>

<p>“Now all hands be seated,” cried the Captain;
“but don’t dare to eat a mouthful until I give the
signal.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished this caution when the
door opened, and Herbert entered, accompanied by
his mother; and then there were such cheers and
shouts and such laughter and such crying as had
never been heard before in this old room since its
first walls had been constructed.</p>

<p>Herbert was literally made speechless by amazement.
His mother, with feminine instinct, took
refuge in tears; but Herbert soon recovered his
voice and his mother soon dried her tears, and very
quickly the clatter of knives and forks and the din
of conversation and the ripple of never-ending
laughter set everyone at ease.</p>

<p>Tomlin, in a spirit of mischief, had set Herbert
Harkins and Mary Black side by side, and during
the dinner the two young people were made the
subject of many good natured jests; but Mary’s
sweet countenance glowed with happiness, and when
Herbert stooped down to speak to her once during
the dinner her cheeks crimsoned in the most beautiful
manner imaginable.</p>

<p>Some philosopher&mdash;if he wasn’t a philosopher
he should have been one&mdash;has said that it never<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
rains but it pours. So it was on this festive occasion.
The first shower came with the announcement
that within six months Herbert would be given
the coveted post of Washington correspondent of
the Argus&mdash;that he should join the company of
the very aristocracy of American journalism. The
next came with the statement that Blakeley&mdash;good-hearted,
blustering Blakeley&mdash;had been made the
managing editor of the Argus, and that Tomlin
would succeed him in the responsible position of
city editor of that journal. At this announcement
Herbert seized the hand of his friend and wrung
it with such fervor that his old room-mate cried
for mercy. After that John Black informed the
assembled company of the selection of his son Arthur
as the cashier and confidential man of his
newly established bank at Cleverly.</p>

<p>Captain Janson was given the floor then, and
amid many elaborate sea phrases and involved sentences
he proclaimed Herbert Harkins as his adopted
son and heir.</p>

<p>Near the close of the dinner, Herbert arose and
with trembling lips and swelling heart announced
that the noblest girl in the whole world had just
promised to become his wife; and although he
mentioned no name, every eye turned instinctively
towards Mary, who finding herself singled out from
all the others, blushed desperately and shrank shyly<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
beneath the united gaze of the company for all the
world like a sweet little violet whose hiding place
has been discovered by a sudden burst of glaring
sunlight.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
